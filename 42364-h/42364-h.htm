<h2>JOURNAL<br />

<small>(PART II)</small></h2>


<p><i>January 1st, 1820.</i>&mdash;I left Princeton at ten o'clock, with
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Wheeler; and here parted with my
good and kind friend Ingle.</p>

<p>I met and spoke, ten miles off, with two hog-jobbing
judges, Judge Prince and Judge Daniel,<a name="FNanchor_104_1" id="FNanchor_104_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_1" class="fnanchor">104</a> driving home
twenty fat hogs, which they had just bought.</p>

<p>I reached, and rested at Petersburgh,<a name="FNanchor_105_2" id="FNanchor_105_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_2" class="fnanchor">105</a> consisting of
fifteen houses. I passed good farms. Our landlord of
this infant town, though having an [333] ostler, was compelled
to groom, saddle, unsaddle, and to do all himself.
Having fifty dollars owing to him, from a gentleman of
Evansville, he arrested him, when he went into the bounds;
then he sued one of the bondsmen, who also entered the
bounds. The squire is next to be sued, who, it is expected,
will do likewise.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 2nd.</i>&mdash;I rode thirty-one miles this day, and
rested at Edmonstone, in a little cold log-hole, out of
which I turned an officer's black cat, which jumped from
the roof into our faces, while in bed; but she soon found
her way in again, through a hole in the roof. The cat
liked our fire. We got no coffee nor tea, but cold milk
and pork, and corn cake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p><p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Travelled all day, through the mud-holes formed
by springs running from countless hills, covered with fine
timber, to breakfast, at three o'clock, p. m. I supped
and slept at Judge Chambers's, a comfortable house, and
saw again the judge's mother, of eighty, whose activity
and superior horsemanship, I have before mentioned. I
smoked a segar with Mrs. Judge, while she smoked her
pipe, (the first pipe I have seen here.) She, as well as the
old lady, is a quaker. The judge was gone to the metropolitan
town of Coridon, being a senator, on duty.<a name="FNanchor_106_3" id="FNanchor_106_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_3" class="fnanchor">106</a>
The land which I passed over all this day, seemed poor,
but full of wild turkeys and bears.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;I reached Miller's to supper, but found no [334]
coffee; cold milk only, as a substitute. The ride hither
is interesting, through a fine rolling country. The wolves
howled around us all night.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Passed the Silver Hills,<a name="FNanchor_107_4" id="FNanchor_107_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_4" class="fnanchor">107</a> from the summit of
which is a fine, extensive prospect of Kentucky, the Ohio,
and of Louisville, where we breakfasted. I called with
Mr. Flower's letter to Archer, who was out. I received
the present of a cow-hide whip, from a lady, and promised
to treat the beast kindly, for her sake. Judge Waggoner
recently shook hands at a whiskey-shop, with a man coming
before him that day, to be tried for murder. He drank
his health, and wished him well through.</p>

<p>I rode seven miles with an intelligent old Kentucky
planter, having four children, who cultivate his farm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
without negroes. He says, "Kentucky is morally and
physically ruined. We have been brought up to live
without labour: all are demoralized. No man's word or
judgment is to be taken for the guidance and government
of another. Deception is a trade, and all are rogues.
The west has the scum of all the earth. Long ago it was
said, when a man left other States, he is gone to hell, or
Kentucky. The people are none the better for a free,
good government. The oldest first settlers are all gone
or ruined. Your colt, sir, of one hundred dollars, is worth
only fifteen dollars. At Louisville, as good a horse can
be bought at ten dollars, or fifteen dollars. You are therefore
cheated."</p>

<p>The Missouri territory boasts the best land in [335] the
country, but is not watered by springs. Wells are, however,
dug, abounding in good water, says our hearty landlord,
just returned from viewing that country.</p>

<p>The bottom land is the finest in the world. Corn, from
sixty to eighty bushels, and wheat, from forty to sixty
bushels an acre. The best prairies are full of fine grass,
flowers, and weeds, not coarse, benty, sticky grass, which
denotes the worst of prairie land. Grass, of a short fine
quality, fit for pasture or hay, every where abounds. The
country is full of wild honey, some houses having made
seven and eight barrels this season, taken out of the trees,
which are cut down without killing the bees. These industrious
insects do not sting, but are easily hived and
made tame. Our landlord likes the Missouri, but not so
well as Old Kentucky.</p>

<p>Two grim, gaunt-looking men burst into our room, at
two, this morning; and by six, the landlord disturbed us
by cow-hiding his negro, threatening to squeeze the life
out of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;I rode all day through a country of fine plantations,
and reached Frankfort to supper, with the legislative
body, where I again met my gay fellow-traveller, Mr.
Cowen. It was interesting to look down our table, and
contemplate the many bright, intelligent faces around me:
men who might honour any nation. As strangers, we
were [336] invited by the landlord, (the best I have seen)
to the first rush for a chance at the table's head.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;I travelled this day through a fine country of
rich pasture and tillage, to Lexington City, to Keen's excellent
tavern. I drank wine with Mr. Lidiard, who is
removing eastward, having spent 1,100<i>l.</i> in living, and
travelling to and fro. Fine beef at three cents per lb.
Fat fowls, one dollar per dozen. Who would not live in
old Kentucky's first city?</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Being a wet day, I rested all day and this night.
Prairie flies bleed horses nearly to death. Smoke and
fire is a refuge to these distressed animals. The Indian
summer smoke reaches to the Isle of Madeira.</p>

<p>Visited the Athen&aelig;um. Viewed some fine horses, at
two hundred dollars each.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 9th.</i>&mdash;I quitted Lexington, and one of the best
taverns in America, for Paris, Kentucky, and a good,
genteel farm-house, the General Washington, twenty-three
miles from the city, belonging to Mr. Hit, who, though
owning between four hundred and five hundred acres of
the finest land in Kentucky, does not think it beneath him
to entertain travellers and their horses, on the best fare
and beds in the country. He has been offered sixty
dollars, and could now have forty dollars an acre, for his
land, which averages thirty bushels of wheat, and sixty
bushels of corn per acre, and, in [337] natural or artificial
grass, is the first in the world. Sheep, (fine stores) one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
dollar per head; beef, fine, three cents per lb., and fowls,
one dollar per dozen.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Rode all day in the rain and mud, and through
the worst roads in the universe, frequently crossing creeks,
belly deep of our horses. Passed the creek at Blue-lick,
belly deep, with sulphurous water running from a sulphur
spring, once a salt spring. The water stinks like the
putrid stagnant water of an English horse-pond, full of
animal dung. This is resorted to for health.</p>

<p>Five or six dirkings and stabbings took place, this fall,
in Kentucky.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted at Washington, (Kentucky) where
we parted with Mr. Phillips, and met the Squire, and
another gentleman, debating about law. Rested at Maysville,
a good house, having chambers, and good beds, with
curtains. The steam-boats pass this handsome river town,
at the rate of fifteen to twenty miles an hour. To the
passenger, the effect is beautiful, every minute presenting
new objects of attraction.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Crossed the Ohio in a flat, submitting to Kentuckyan
imposition of seventy-five cents a horse, instead
of twenty-five, because we were supposed to be Yankees.
"We will not," said the boat-man, "take you over, for
less than a dollar each. We heard of you, yesterday. The
gentleman in the cap (meaning me) looks as though he
[338] could afford to pay, and besides, he is so slick with
his tongue. The Yankees are the smartest of fellows,
except the Kentuckyans." Sauciness and impudence are
characteristic of these boat-men, who wished I would
commence a bridge over the river.</p>

<p>Reached Union town, Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_108_5" id="FNanchor_108_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_5" class="fnanchor">108</a> and rested for the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted at Colonel Wood's. A fine breakfast
on beef, pork-steaks, eggs, and coffee, and plenty for
our horses, all for fifty cents each. Slept at Colonel Peril's,
an old Virginian revolutionary soldier, living on 400 acres
of fine land, in a good house, on an eminence, which he
has held two years only. He now wishes to sell all at ten
dollars an acre, less than it cost him, because he has a
family who will all want as much land each, in the Missouri,
at two dollars. He never had a negro. He knows
us to be English from our dialect. We passed, this day,
through two or three young villages.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted at Bainbridge,<a name="FNanchor_109_6" id="FNanchor_109_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_6" class="fnanchor">109</a> where is good
bottom land, at twenty to thirty dollars an acre, with improvements.
The old Virginian complains of want of
labourers. A farmer must do all himself. Received of
our landlady a lump of Ohio wild sugar, of which some
families make from six to ten barrels a-year, sweet and
good enough.</p>

<p>Reached Chilicoth&eacute;, on the Sciota river, to [339] sup
and rest at the tavern of Mr. Madera, a sensible young
man. Here I met Mr. Randolph, a gentleman of Philadelphia,
from Missouri and Illinois, who thinks both
sickly, and not to be preferred to the east, or others parts
of the west. I saw three or four good houses, in the best
street, abandoned, and the windows and doors rotting out
for want of occupants.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;I rode all day through a fine interesting country,
abounding with every good thing, and full of springs and
streams. Near Lancaster,<a name="FNanchor_110_7" id="FNanchor_110_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_7" class="fnanchor">110</a> I passed a large high ridge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of rocks, which nature has clothed in everlasting green,
being beautified with the spruce, waving like feathers,
on their bleak, barren tops. I reached Lancaster to rest;
a handsome county seat, near which land is selling occasionally
from sixteen dollars to twenty dollars. A fine
farm of 170 acres, 100 being cleared, with all improvements,
was sold lately by the sheriff, at sixteen dollars one
cent an acre, much less than it cost. Labour is to be had
at fifty cents and board, but as the produce is so low, it
is thought farming, by hired hands, does not pay. Wheat,
fifty cents; corn, 33&frac12; cents; potatoes, 33 cents a bushel;
beef, four dollars per cwt.; pork, three dollars; mutton
none; sheep being kept only for the wool, and bought in
common at 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per head.</p>

<p>Met Judge and General &mdash;&mdash;, who states that four millions
of acres of land will this year [340] be offered to sale,
bordering on the lakes. Why then should people go to
the Missouri? It is not healthy near the lakes, on account
of stagnant waters, made by sand bars, at the mouth of
lake rivers. The regular periodical rising and falling of
the lakes is not yet accounted for. There is no sensible
diminution, or increase of the lake-waters. A grand canal
is to be completed in five years, when boats will travel.<a name="FNanchor_111_8" id="FNanchor_111_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_8" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, 16th.</i>&mdash;I left Lancaster at peep of day, travelling
through intense cold and icy roads to Somerset,
eighteen miles, in five hours, to breakfast.<a name="FNanchor_112_9" id="FNanchor_112_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_9" class="fnanchor">112</a> Warmed at
an old quarter-section man, a Dutch American, from
Pennsylvania. He came here eleven years since, cleared
seventy acres, has eight children, likes his land, but says,
produce is too low to make it worth raising. People<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
comfortably settled in the east, on good farms, should
stay, unless their children can come and work on the land.
He and his young family do all the work. Has a fine
stove below, warming the first, and all other floors, by
a pipe passing through them.</p>

<p>I slept at a good tavern, the keeper of which is a farmer.
All are farmers, and all the best farmers are tavern-keepers.
Farms, therefore, on the road, sell from 50 to 100 per cent
more than land lying back, though it is no better in quality,
and for mere farming, worth no more. But on the road,
a farm and frequented tavern is found to be [341] a very
beneficial mode of using land; the produce selling for double
and treble what it will bring at market, and also fetching
ready money. Labour is not to be commanded, says our
landlord.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;Started at peep of day in a snow-storm, which
had covered the ground six inches deep. Breakfasted at
beautiful Zanesville, a town most delightfully situated
amongst the hills. Twelve miles from this town, one
Chandler, in boring for salt, hit upon silver; a mine, seven
feet thick, 150 feet below the surface. It is very pure
ore, and the proprietor has given up two acres of the
land to persons who have applied to the legislature to
be incorporated. He is to receive one-fifth of the net
profits.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;I rode all day through a fine hilly country, full
of springs and fountains. The land is more adapted for
good pasture than for cultivation. Our landlord, Mr.
Gill, states that wheat at fifty cents is too low; but, even
at that price, there is no market, nor at any other. In
some former years, Orleans was a market, but now it
gets supplied from countries more conveniently situated
than Ohio, from which it costs one dollar, or one dollar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and a quarter per barrel, to send it. Boats carrying from
100 to 500 barrels, sell for only 16 dollars.</p>

<p>From a conversation, with an intelligent High Sheriff
of this county, I learn that no common debtor has ever
lain in prison longer than five [342] days. None need be
longer in giving security for the surrender of all property.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;Reached Wheeling late at night, passing through
a romantic, broken, mountainous country, with many fine
springs and creeks. Thus I left Ohio, which, thirty years
ago, was a frontier state, full of Indians, without a white
man's house, between Wheeling, Kaskasky, and St. Louis.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Reached Washington, Pennsylvania, to sleep,
and found our tavern full of thirsty classics, from the seminary
in this town.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Reached Pittsburgh, through a beautiful country
of hills, fit only for pasture. I viewed the fine covered
bridges over the two rivers Monongahela and Allegany,
which cost 10,000 dollars each. The hills around the city
shut it in, and make the descent into it frightfully precipitous.
It is most eligibly situated amidst rocks, or rather
hills, of coal, stone, and iron, the coals lying up to the
surface, ready for use. One of these hills, or coal banks,
has been long on fire, and resembles a volcano. Bountiful
nature has done every thing for this rising Birmingham of
America.</p>

<p>We slept at Wheeling, at the good hotel of Major Spriggs,
one of General Washington's revolutionary officers, now
near 80, a chronicle of years departed.<a name="FNanchor_113_10" id="FNanchor_113_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_10" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Bought a fine buffalo robe for five dollars. [343]
The buffaloes, when Kentucky was first settled, were shot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
by the settlers, merely for their tongues; the carcase and
skin being thought worth nothing, were left where the
animal fell.</p>

<p>Left Pittsburgh for Greensburgh, travelling through a
fine, cultivated, thickly settled country, full of neat, flourishing,
and good farms, the occupants of which are said
to be rich. Land, <i>on</i> the road, is worth from fifteen to
thirty dollars; <i>from</i> it, five to fifteen dollars per acre. The
hills and mountains seem full of coal-mines and stone-quarries,
or rather banks of coal and stone ever open
gratuitously to all. The people about here are economical
and intelligent; qualities characteristic of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 23d.</i>&mdash;We agreed to rest here until the morrow;
finding one of our best horses sick; and went to Pittsburgh
church.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;My fellow traveller finding his horse getting
worse, gave him away for our tavern bill of two days, thus
paying 175 dollars for two days board. While this fine
animal remained ours, no doctor could be found, but as
soon as he became our landlord's, one was discovered, who
engaged to cure him in a week. Mr. Wheeler took my
horse, and left me to come on in the stage, to meet again
at Chambersburgh.</p>

<p>The country round about here is fine, but there is no
market, except at Baltimore, at five dollars a barrel for
flour. The carriage costs two and half [344] dollars. I
saw two young ladies, Dutch farmers' daughters, smoking
segars in our tavern, very freely, and made one of
their party. Paid twelve dollars for fare to Chambersburgh.<a name="FNanchor_114_11" id="FNanchor_114_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_11" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Invited to a sleying party of ten gentlemen, one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whom was the venerable speaker (Brady) of the senate
of this state. They were nearly all drunk with apple-toddy,
a large bowl of which was handed to every drinker.
One gentleman returned with a cracked skull.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;Left this town, at three o'clock in the morning, in
the stage, and met again at Bedford, and parted, perhaps,
for ever, with my agreeable fellow-traveller, Mr. Wheeler,
who passed on to New York. Passed the Laurel-hill, a
huge mountain, covered with everlasting green, and a refuge
for bears, one of which was recently killed with a
pig of 150lbs. weight in his mouth.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;Again mounted my horse, passing the lonely
Allegany mountains, all day, in a blinding snow-storm,
rendering the air as dense as a November fog in London.
Previous to its coming on, I found my naked nose in danger.
The noses of others were wrapped up in flannel
bags, or cots, and masks for the eyes, which are liable to
freeze into balls of ice.</p>

<p>Passed several flourishing villages. The people here
seem more economical and simple, than in other states.
Rested at M'Connell's town, 100 miles from Washington
city.</p>

<p>[345] <i>27th.</i>&mdash;Crossed the last of the huge Allegany
mountains, called the North Mount, nine miles over, and
very high. My horse was belly deep in snow.</p>

<p>Breakfasted at Mercersburgh, at the foot of the above
mountain, and at the commencement of that fine and richest
valley in the eastern states, in which Hagar's town
stands, and which extends through Pennsylvania, Maryland,
and Virginia, from 100 to 200 miles long, and from
30 to 40 broad. Land here, three years ago, sold at 100
to 120 dollars, although now at a forced sale, 160 acres
sold for only 1,600 dollars, with improvements, in Penn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>sylvania.
And if, says my informant, the state makes
no law to prevent it, much must come into the market,
without money to buy, except at a ruinous depreciation.</p>

<p>Passed Hagar's town, to Boonsburgh, to rest all night,
after 37 miles travel.</p>

<p>The old Pennsylvanian farmer, in answer to "How do
you do without negroes?" said, "Better than with them.
I occupy of my father 80 acres in this valley, and hire all
my hands, and sell five loads of flour, while some of the
Marylanders and Virginians cannot raise enough to maintain
their negroes, who do but little work."</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted on the road; passed Middletown,
with two fine spires, a good town; and also Frederick town,
a noble inland town, and next to Lancaster, in Pennsylvania,
and the first [346] in the United States. It has
three beautiful spires. It is much like a second rate
English town, but not so cleanly; something is dirty, or
in ruins. It stands at the foot of the Blue Ridge, in the
finest, largest vale in the world, running from the eastern
sea to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Rested at Windmiller's, a stage-house, thirty miles from
Washington, distinguished only by infamous, ungenerous,
extortion from travellers. Here I paid 75 cents for tea;
25 cents for a pint of beer, 9<i>s.</i> sterling for a bushel of oats
and corn, and 50 cents for hay for the night. The horse
cost 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> in one night.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Rode from seven till eleven o'clock, sixteen miles
to breakfast, at Montgomery-court-house, all drenched in
rain. I reached Washington city, at six this evening.
Here, for the first time, I met friend Joseph Lancaster,
full of visionary schemes, which are unlikely to produce
him bread.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 30th.</i>&mdash;Went to Congress-hall, and heard grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
senators wrangling about slavery. Governor Barbour
spoke with eloquence.</p>

<p>Friend Lancaster's daily and familiar calls on the great,
and on his Excellency, the President, about schooling the
Indians, and his praises of the members, are likely to wear
out all his former fame, already much in ruins. I was this
day introduced by him to &mdash;&mdash; Parr, Esq., an English
gentleman of fortune, from Boston, Lincolnshire, [347]
who has just returned from a pedestrian pilgrimage to
Birkbeck and the western country.</p>

<p><i>February 1st.</i>&mdash;I again went to Congress, where I heard
Mr. Randolph's good speech on the Missouri question.
This sensible orator continually refers to English authors
and orators, insomuch that all seemed English. These
American statesmen cannot open their mouths without
acknowledging their British origin and obligations.&mdash;I
shall here insert some observations on the constitution
and laws of this country, and on several of the most distinguished
members of Congress, for which I am indebted
to the pen of G. Waterstone, Esq., Congressional Librarian
at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_115_12" id="FNanchor_115_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_12" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>


<p class="nblockquot"><i>Observations on the Constitution and Laws of the United
States, with Sketches of some of the most prominent public
Characters.</i></p>

<p>Like the Minerva of the ancients, the American people
have sprung, at once, into full and vigorous maturity, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>out
the imbecility of infancy, or the tedious process of gradual
progression. They possess none of the thoughtless
liberality and inconsiderate confidence of youth; but are,
already, distinguished by the cold and cautious policy of
declining life, rendered suspicious by a long acquaintance
with the deceptions and the vices of the world.</p>

<p>Practitioners of jurisprudence have become [348] almost
innumerable, and the great end of all laws, the security
and protection of the citizen, is in some degree defeated.
It is to the multiplicity and ambiguity of the laws of his
age, that Tacitus has ascribed most of the miseries which
were then experienced; and this evil will always be felt
where they are ambiguous and too numerous. In vain
do the Americans urge that their laws have been founded
on those of England, the wisdom and excellence of which
have been so highly and extravagantly eulogized. The
difference, as Mably correctly observes, between the situation
of this country and that is prodigious;<a name="FNanchor_116_13" id="FNanchor_116_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_13" class="fnanchor">116</a> the government
of one having been formed in an age of refinement
and civilization, and that of the other, amidst the darkness
and barbarism of feudal ignorance. In most of the states
the civil and criminal code is defective; and the latter, like
that of Draco, is often written in blood. Why should not
each state form a code of laws for itself, and cast off this
slavish dependence on Great Britain, whom they pretend
so much to dislike?</p>

<p>With a view of explaining more perfectly the nature of
this constitution, I will briefly exhibit the points in which
the British and American governments differ [349].<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be unnecessary to adduce more points
of difference to illustrate the nature of the American
government. These are amply sufficient to demonstrate
the entire democratic tendency of the constitution of the
United States, and the error under which those persons
labour, who believe that but few differences, and those
immaterial and unimportant, exist between these two
governments. They have, indeed, in common the Habeas
Corpus and the Trial by Jury, the great bulwarks of
civil liberty, but in almost every other particular they
disagree.</p>

<p>The second branch of this government is the legislature.
This consists of a Senate and House of Representatives;
the members of the latter are chosen every two years by
the people; and those of the former, every six years by the
legislatures of the different states. It is in this branch
that the American government differs from the republics
of ancient and modern times; it is this which [351] makes
it not a pure, but a representative democracy; and it is
this which gives it such a decided superiority over all the
governments in the world. Experience has demonstrated
the impracticability of assembling a numerous collection
of people to frame laws, and their incompetency, when
assembled, for judicious deliberation and prompt and unbiassed
decision. The passions of illiterate and unthinking
men are easily roused into action and inflamed to
madness. Artful and designing demagogues are too apt to
take advantage of those imbecilities of our nature, and to
convert them to the basest purposes.</p>

<p>The qualifications of representatives are very simple. It
is only required that they should be citizens of the United
States, and have attained the age of twenty-five. The
moment their period of service expires, they are again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
unless re-elected, reduced to the rank and condition of
citizens. If they should have acted in opposition to the
wishes and interests of their constituents, while performing
the functions of legislation, the people possess the remedy
and can exercise it without endangering the peace and
harmony of society; the offending member is dropped, and
his place supplied by another, more worthy of confidence.
This consciousness of responsibility, on the part of the
representatives, operates as a perpetual guarantee to the
people, and protects and secures them in the enjoyment
of their political and civil liberties.</p>

<p>[352] It must be admitted that the Americans have
attained the <i>Ultima Thul&eacute;</i> in representative legislation, and
that they enjoy this inestimable blessing to a much greater
extent than the people of Great Britain. Of the three distinct
and independent branches of that government, one
only owes its existence to the free suffrages of the people,
and this, from the inequality of representation, the long
intervals between the periods of election, and the liability
of members, from this circumstance, to be corrupted, is not
so important and useful a branch as might otherwise be
expected. Imperfect, however, as it is, the people, without
it, would indeed be slaves, and the government nothing
more than a pure monarchy.</p>

<p>The American walks abroad in the majesty of freedom;
if he be innocent, he shrinks not from the gaze of upstart
and insignificant wealth, nor sinks beneath the oppression
of his fellow-man. Conscious of his rights and of the
security he enjoys, by the liberal institutions of his country,
independence beams in his eye, and humanity glows in
his heart. Has he done wrong? He knows the limits
of his punishment, and the character of his judges. Is
he innocent? He feels that no power on earth can crush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him. What a condition is this, compared with that of the
subjects of almost all the European nations!</p>

<p>As long as it is preserved, the security of the citizen
and the union of the states, will be guaranteed, [353] and
the country thus governed, will become the home of the
free, the retreat of misery, and the asylum of persecuted
humanity. As a written compact, it is a phenomenon in
politics, an unprecedented and perfect example of representative
democracy, to which the attention of mankind is
now enthusiastically directed. Most happily and exquisitely
organized, the American constitution is, in truth,
at once "a monument of genius, and an edifice of strength
and majesty." The union of its parts forms its solidity,
and the harmony of its proportions constitutes its beauty.
May it always be preserved inviolate by the gallant and
highminded people of America, and may they never forget
that its destruction will be the inevitable death-blow of
liberty, and the probable passport to universal despotism!</p>

<p>The speaker of the House of Representatives is Mr. Clay,
a delegate from Kentucky, and who, not long ago, acted
a conspicuous part, as one of the American commissioners
at Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_117_14" id="FNanchor_117_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_14" class="fnanchor">117</a> He is a tall, thin, and not very muscular
man; his gait is stately, but swinging; and his countenance,
while it indicates genius, denotes dissipation. As an
orator, Mr. Clay stands high in the estimation of his
countrymen, but he does not possess much gracefulness or
elegance of manner; his eloquence is impetuous and vehement;
it rolls like a torrent, but like a torrent which is
sometimes irregular, and occasionally obstructed. Though
there is a [354] want of rapidity and fluency in his elocu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>tion,
yet he has a great deal of fire and vigour in his expression.
When he speaks he is full of animation and
earnestness; his face brightens, his eye beams with additional
lustre, and his whole figure indicates that he is
entirely occupied with the subject on which his eloquence
is employed. In action, on which Demosthenes laid such
peculiar emphasis, and which was so highly esteemed
among the ancients, Mr. Clay is neither very graceful nor
very imposing. He does not, in the language of Shakespear,
"so suit the word to the action, and the action to
the word, as not to o'erstep the modesty of nature." In
his gesticulation and attitudes, there is sometimes an uniformity
and awkwardness that lessen his merit as an orator,
and in some measure destroy the impression and effect his
eloquence would otherwise produce. Mr. Clay does not
seem to have studied rhetoric as a science, or to have paid
much attention to those artificial divisions and rhetorical
graces and ornaments on which the orators of antiquity
so strongly insist. Indeed, oratory as an art is but little
studied in this country. Public speakers here trust almost
entirely to the efficacy of their own native powers for
success in the different fields of eloquence, and search not
for the extrinsic embellishments and facilities of art. It
is but rarely they unite the Attic and Rhodian manner,
and still more rarely do they devote their attention to the
acquisition [355] of those accomplishments which were,
in the refined ages of Greece and Rome, considered so
essential to the completion of an orator. Mr. Clay, however,
is an eloquent speaker; and notwithstanding the defects
I have mentioned, very seldom fails to please and
convince. His mind is so organized that he overcomes
the difficulties of abstruse and complicated subjects,
apparently without the toil of investigation or the labour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of profound research. It is rich, and active, and rapid,
grasping at one glance, connections the most distant, and
consequences the most remote, and breaking down the
trammels of error and the cobwebs of sophistry. When he
rises to speak he always commands attention, and almost
always satisfies the mind on which his eloquence is intended
to operate. The warmth and fervor of his feelings,
and the natural impetuosity of his character, which seem
to be common to the Kentuckians, often indeed lead him
to the adoption of opinions, which are not, at all times,
consistent with the dictates of sound policy. Though
ambitious and persevering, his intentions are good and
his heart is pure; he is propelled by a love of country, but
yet is solicitous of distinction; he wishes to attain the pinnacle
of greatness without infringing the liberties, or marring
the prosperity of that land of which it seems to be his
glory to be a native.</p>

<p>[356] The prominent traits of Mr. Clay's mind are quickness,
penetration, and acuteness; a fertile invention, discriminating
judgment, and good memory. His attention
does not seem to have been much devoted to literary or
scientific pursuits, unconnected with his profession; but
fertile in resources, and abounding in expedients, he is seldom
at a loss, and if he is not at all times able to amplify
and embellish, he but rarely fails to do justice to the subject
which has called forth his eloquence. On the most
complicated questions, his observations made immediately
and on the spur of the occasion, are generally such
as would be suggested by long and deep reflection. In
short, Mr. Clay has been gifted by nature with great intellectual
superiority, which will always give him a decided
influence in whatever sphere it may be his destiny to revolve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Clay's manners are plain and easy. He has nothing
in him of that reserve which checks confidence, and which
some politicians assume; his views of mankind are enlarged
and liberal; and his conduct as a politician and a
statesman has been marked with the same enlarged and
liberal policy. As Speaker of the House of Representatives,
he presides generally with great dignity, and decides
on questions of order, sometimes, indeed, with too much
precipitation, but almost always correctly. It is but
seldom his decisions are disputed, [357] and when they
are, they are not often reversed.<a name="FNanchor_118_15" id="FNanchor_118_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_15" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>"A Statesman," says Mirabeau, "presents to the mind
the idea of a vast genius improved by experience, capable
of embracing the mass of social interests, and of perceiving
how to maintain true harmony among the individuals of
which society is composed, and an extent of information
which may give substance and union to the different
operations of government."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkney<a name="FNanchor_119_16" id="FNanchor_119_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_16" class="fnanchor">119</a> is between fifty and sixty years of age;
his form is sufficiently elevated and compact to be graceful,
and his countenance, though marked by the lines of dissi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>pation,
and rather too heavy, is not unprepossessing or
repulsive. His eye is rapid in its motion, and beams with
the animation of genius; but his lips are too thick, and his
cheeks too fleshy and loose for beauty; there is too a degree
of foppery, and sometimes of splendor, manifested
in the decoration of his person, which is not perfectly reconcileable
to our [358] ideas of mental superiority, and
an appearance of voluptuousness about him which cannot
surely be a source of pride or of gratification to one whose
mind is so capacious and elegant. It is not improbable,
however, that this character is assumed merely for the
purpose of exciting a higher admiration of his powers, by
inducing a belief that, without the labour of study or the
toil of investigation, he can attain the object of his wishes
and become eminent, without deigning to resort to that
painful drudgery by which meaner minds and inferior intellects
are enabled to arrive at excellence and distinction.
At the first glance, you would imagine Mr. Pinkney was
one of those butterflies of fashion, <i>a dandy</i>, known by their
extravagant eccentricities of dress, and peculiarities of
manners; and no one could believe, from his external
appearance, that he was, in the least degree, intellectually
superior to his fellow men. But Mr. Pinkney is indeed
a wonderful man, and one of those beings whom the lover
of human nature feels a delight in contemplating. His
mind is of the very first order; quick, expanded, fervid,
and powerful. The hearer is at a loss which most to
admire, the vigour of his judgment, the fertility of his invention,
the strength of his memory, or the power of his
imagination. Each of these faculties he possesses in an
equal degree of perfection, and each is displayed in its
full maturity, when the [359] magnitude of the subject on
which he descants renders its operation necessary. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
singular union of the rare and precious gifts of nature, has
received all the strength which education could afford,
and all the polish and splendour which art could bestow.
Under the cloak of dissipation and voluptuousness his
application has been indefatigable, and his studies unintermitted:
the oil of the midnight lamp has been exhausted,
and the labyrinths of knowledge have been
explored.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkney is never unprepared, and never off his
guard. He encounters his subject with a mind rich in all
the gifts of nature, and fraught with all the resources of art
and study. He enters the list with his antagonist, armed,
like the ancient cavalier, cap-a-pee; and is alike prepared
to wield the lance, or to handle the sword, as occasion
may require. In cases which embrace all the complications
and intricacies of law, where reason seems to be lost
in the chaos of technical perplexity, and obscurity and
darkness assume the dignified character of science, he
displays an extent of research, a range of investigation,
a lucidness of reasoning, and a fervor and brilliancy of
thought, that excite our wonder, and elicit our admiration.
On the driest, most abstract, and uninteresting questions
of law, when no mind can anticipate such an occurrence,
he occasionally blazes forth in all the enchanting
exuberance of a chastened, but rich [360] and vivid imagination,
and paints in a manner as classical as it is
splendid, and as polished as it is brilliant. In the higher
grades of eloquence, where the passions and feelings of
our nature are roused to action, or lulled to tranquillity,
Mr. Pinkney is still the great magician, whose power is
resistless, and whose touch is fascination. His eloquence
becomes sublime and impassioned, majestic and overwhelming.
In calmer moments, when these passions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
hushed, and more tempered feelings have assumed the
place of agitation and disorder, he weaves around you the
fairy circles of fancy, and calls up the golden palaces and
magnificent scenes of enchantment. You listen with
rapture as he rolls along: his defects vanish, and you are
not conscious of any thing but what he pleases to infuse.
From his tongue, like that of Nestor, "language more
sweet than honey flows;" and the attention is constantly
rivetted by the successive operation of the different faculties
of the mind. There are no awkward pauses, no hesitation
for want of words or of arguments: he moves forward
with a pace sometimes majestic, sometimes graceful,
but always captivating and elegant. His order is lucid, his
reasoning logical, his diction select, magnificent, and
appropriate, and his style, flowing, oratorical, and beautiful.
The most laboured and finished composition could
not be better than that which he seems to utter [361] spontaneously
and without effort. His judgment, invention,
memory, and imagination, all conspire to furnish him at
once with whatever he may require to enforce, embellish,
or illustrate his subject. On the dullest topic he is never
dry: and no one leaves him without feeling an admiration
of his powers, that borders on enthusiasm. His satire is
keen, but delicate, and his wit is scintillating and brilliant.
His treasure is exhaustless, possessing the most extensive
and varied information. He never feels at a loss; and he
ornaments and illustrates every subject he touches.
<i>Nihil quod tetigit, non ornavit.</i> He is never the same; he
uses no common place artifice to excite a momentary thrill
of admiration. He is not obliged to patch up and embellish
a few ordinary thoughts, or set off a few meagre
and uninteresting facts. His resources seem to be as unlimited
as those of nature; and fresh powers, and new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
beauties are exhibited, whenever his eloquence is employed.
A singular copiousness and felicity of thought
and expression, united to a magnificence of amplification,
and a purity and chastity of ornament, give to his eloquence
a sort of enchantment which it is difficult to describe.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkney's mind is in a high degree poetical; it
sometimes wantons in the luxuriance of its own creations;
but these creations never violate the purity of classical
taste and elegance. He [362] loves to paint when there
is no occasion to reason; and addresses the imagination
and passions, when the judgment has been satisfied and
enlightened. I speak of Mr. Pinkney at present as a
forensic orator. His career was too short to afford an
opportunity of judging of his parliamentary eloquence;
and, perhaps, like Curran, he might have failed in a field
in which it was anticipated he would excel, or, at least,
retain his usual pre-eminence. Mr. Pinkney, I think,
bears a stronger resemblance to Burke than to Pitt; but,
in some particulars, he unites the excellences of both. He
has the fancy and erudition of the former, and the point,
rapidity, and elocution of the latter. Compared with his
countrymen, he wants the vigour and striking majesty of
Clay, the originality and ingenuity of Calhoun; but, as a
rhetorician, he surpasses both. In his action, Mr. Pinkney
has, unfortunately, acquired a manner, borrowed, no
doubt, from some illustrious model, which is eminently
uncouth and inelegant. It consists in raising one leg on
a bench or chair before him, and in thrusting his right
arm in a horizontal line from his side to its full length in
front. This action is uniform, and never varies or changes
in the most tranquil flow of sentiment, or the grandest
burst of impassioned eloquence. His voice, though not
naturally good, has been disciplined to modulation by art;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and, if it is not always musical, it is [363] never very harsh
or offensive. Such is Mr. Pinkney as an orator; as a diplomatist
but little can be said that will add to his reputation.
In his official notes there is too much flippancy, and too
great diffuseness, for beauty or elegance of composition.
It is but seldom that the orator possesses the requisites of
the writer; and the fame which is acquired by the tongue
sometimes evaporates through the pen. As a writer he
is inferior to the present Attorney-General,<a name="FNanchor_120_17" id="FNanchor_120_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_17" class="fnanchor">120</a> who unites
the powers of both in a high degree, and thus in his own
person illustrates the position which he has laid down, as
to the universality of genius.</p>

<p>Mr. R. King is a senator from the State of New York,
and was formerly the resident minister at the court of St.
James's.<a name="FNanchor_121_18" id="FNanchor_121_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_18" class="fnanchor">121</a> He is now about sixty years of age, above the
middle size, and somewhat inclined to corpulency. His
countenance, when serious and thoughtful, possesses a
great deal of austerity and rigour; but at other moments
it is marked with placidity and benevolence. Among his
friends he is facetious and easy; but when with strangers,
reserved and distant; apparently indisposed to conversation,
and inclined to taciturnity; but when called out, his
colloquial powers are of no ordinary character, and his
conversation becomes peculiarly instructive, fascinating,
and humourous. Mr. King has read and reflected much;
and though long in public life, his attention [364] has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
not been exclusively devoted to the political sciences; for
his information on other subjects is equally matured and
extensive. His resources are numerous and multiplied,
and can easily be called into operation. In his parliamentary
addresses he always displays a deep and intimate
knowledge of the subject under discussion, and never fails
to edify and instruct if he ceases to delight. He has read
history to become a statesman, and not for the mere
gratification it affords. He applies the experience of
ages, which the historical muse exhibits, to the general
purposes of government, and thus reduces to practice the
mass of knowledge with which his mind is fraught and
embellished. As a legislator he is, perhaps, inferior to
no man in this country. The faculty of close and accurate
observation by which he is distinguished has enabled him
to remark and treasure up every fact of political importance,
that has occurred since the organization of the American
government; and the citizen, as well as the stranger, is
often surprised at the minuteness of his historical details,
and the facility with which they are applied. With the
various subjects immediately connected with politics, he
has made himself well acquainted; and such is the strength
of his memory, and the extent of his information, that the
accuracy of his statements is never disputed. Mr. King,
however, is somewhat of an [365] enthusiast, and his feelings
sometimes propel him to do that which his judgment
cannot sanction. When parties existed in this country,
he belonged to, and was considered to be the leader of
what was denominated the federal phalanx; and he has
often, perhaps, been induced, from the influence of party
feeling, and the violence of party animosity, to countenance
measures that must have wounded his moral sensibilities;
and that now, when reason is suffered to dictate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
cannot but be deeply regretted. From a rapid survey of
his political and parliamentary career, it would appear
that the fury of party has betrayed him into the expression
of sentiments, and the support of measures, that were, in
their character, revolting to his feelings; but whatever he
may have been charged with, his intentions, at least, were
pure, and his exertions, as he conceived, calculated for the
public good. He was indeed <i>cried down</i> by a class of
emigrants from the mother country, who have far too great
a sway in the political transactions of the United States;
and though, unquestionably, an ornament to the nation
which has given him birth, his countrymen, averse to him
from party considerations, joined in the cry, and he became
a victim, perhaps, to the duty he owed, and the love
he bore to his country. Prejudice, however, does not
always continue, and the American people, with that good
sense which forms so prominent a feature of their character,
are beginning justly to appreciate those [366] virtues
and talents, they once so much decried. Mr. King has a
sound and discriminating mind, a memory uncommonly
tenacious, and a judgment, vigorous, prompt, and decisive.
He either wants imagination, or is unwilling to employ
a faculty that he conceives only calculated to flatter
and delight. His object is more to convince and persuade,
by the force of reason, than to amuse the mind by the
fantastic embroidery and gaudy festoonings of fancy. His
style of eloquence is plain, but bold and manly; replete
with argument, and full of intelligence; neither impetuous
nor vehement, but flowing and persuasive. His mind,
like that of Fox, is historical; it embraces consequences
the most distant with rapidity and ease. Facts form the
basis of his reasoning. Without these his analysis is de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>fective,
and his combinations and deductions are often
incorrect. His logic is not artificial, but natural: he
abandons its formal divisions, non-essentials, moods, and
figures, to weaker minds, and adheres to the substantials
of natural reason. Of Mr. King's moral character I can
say nothing from my own personal knowledge, as my acquaintance
with him has not been long and intimate
enough to enable me to judge correctly. I have not, however,
heard any thing alleged against it calculated to lessen
his reputation as an honourable statesman, or a virtuous
member of society. He is wealthy, and has, no doubt,
something of pride and hauteur in his manner, [367]
offensive to the spirit of republicanism, and inconsistent
with the nature of equality; but, as a father, husband, and
friend, I have not yet heard him charged with any dereliction
of duty, or any violation of those principles which
tend to harmonize society, and to unite man to man by
the bonds of affection and virtue. I must now beg permission
to despatch the portrait of Mr. King, in order to
submit to your inspection an imperfect likeness of another
member of the same body. This is not the country to look
for the blazonry and trappings of ancestry; merit alone
claims and receives distinction; and none but the fool or
the simpleton, ever pretends to boast of his ancestry and
noble blood, or to offer it as a claim to respect or preferment.
The people alone form the tribunal to which every
aspirant for fame or honour must submit; and they are too
enlightened and too independent to favour insignificance,
though surrounded by the splendour of wealth, or to countenance
stupidity, though descended from those who were
once illustrious and great.</p>

<p>James Barbour is a senator from Virginia, his native<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
state.<a name="FNanchor_122_19" id="FNanchor_122_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_19" class="fnanchor">122</a> He was in his youth a deputy sheriff of the county
in which he was born, and received an education which
was merely intended to fit him for an ordinary station in
life. He felt, however, superior to his condition, and
stimulated by that love of fame which often characterizes
genius, he devoted himself to study, and became [368] a
practitioner of the law. He rose rapidly in his profession,
and soon acquired both wealth and reputation. Like
most of the barristers of this country, he conceived that
to be a lawyer was necessarily to be a politician, and he
rushed forward into public life to extend his fame and
enlarge his sphere of action. From a member of the
house of delegates he was elevated to the gubernatorial
chair of Virginia, and received the highest honour his
native state could confer. Gratified thus far in the wishes
he had formed, he became desirous to enter on a more enlarged
theatre, where his talents would have a greater field
of action, and his eloquence a wider range and better
effect, and he accepted the situation of senator of the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbour commenced his career with a speech
against the establishment of the national bank, which was
then in agitation. He had come fraught with prejudices
against this mammoth institution, and in the fervor of the
moment gave vent to those prejudices in a manner certainly
very eloquent, but not very judicious. When he
had soberly weighed the good and evil with which it might
be attended, the peculiar condition of his country, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
necessity of adopting some scheme by which the difficulties
of government should be obviated, and its financial embarrassment
relieved, he very candidly confessed the error
into which his feelings had betrayed him, and [369] in a
speech, conceived and uttered in the very spirit of true
eloquence, supported the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbour is, in person, muscular and vigorous, and
rather inclined to corpulency. His eyebrows are thick
and bushy, which gives to his countenance a little too
much the appearance of ferocity, but this is counterbalanced
by a peculiar expression in his visage, that conveys
a sentiment of mildness and humanity. He seems
to be above forty years of age, and is about five feet ten
inches high. Of his mind, the prominent characters are
brilliancy and fervor. He has more imagination than
judgment, and more splendor than solidity. His memory
is not very retentive, because it has never been much employed,
except to treasure up poetical images, and to preserve
the spangles and tinsel of oratory. As an orator,
Mr. Barbour has some great defects. His style is too
artificial and verbose, and he seems always more
solicitous to shine and dazzle than convince or persuade.
He labours after splendid images, and strives to fill the
ear more with sound than sense. His sentences are sometimes
involved and complicated, replete with <i>sesquipedalia
verba</i>, and too much charged with "guns, trumpets, blunderbuss,
and thunder." He has unfortunately laid down
to himself a model, which, with reverence be it spoken,
is not the best that could have been adopted. Curran
has gone a great way to corrupt the taste of the present
age. His powers [370] were certainly very extraordinary,
but his taste was bad, and by yielding too much to the impulse
of a highly poetical imagination, he filled the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of his hearer with fine paintings indeed, and left it at last
glowing, but vacant, delighted, but unconvinced. Too
many of the youths of this country seem to be smitten with
the model which he has thus given, and which is certainly
calculated to fire an ardent mind, and lead it astray from
the principles of correct taste and genuine oratory. Mr.
Barbour, however, is frequently not only very fluent but
very persuasive, and he often employs his full flowing
oratorical style to great advantage in setting off his argument,
and in decorating and enforcing his reasoning.
From the want of opportunities, his reading, like that of
most of the politicians of this country, has been confined,
and his range of thought, from the absence of that knowledge
which books afford, is necessarily limited. He has,
indeed, derived advantages from an association with men
of literary and scientific attainments, but he has still much
to acquire to render him eminent as a statesman. The
contributions, which, from this circumstance, he is compelled
to levy on his own unaided native resources, have,
however, tended to sharpen his intellectual powers, and
to give them vivacity and quickness. Mr. Barbour seldom
thinks deeply, but he is always rapid; and though
his observations are sometimes trite and ordinary, there
is almost always something [371] new and gratifying in
the manner in which they are uttered. His mind does
not appear organized for long continued investigation,
and nature has formed him more for a poet than a mathematician.
He is rather too anxious to be thought a great
orator, and this over-ruling propensity is manifested even
in common conversation; when, instead of ease, simplicity,
and conciseness, he discovers the formal elocution of the
public speaker, on the most unimportant and incidental
subjects. In private circles, Mr. Barbour is always very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
pleasant, and exhibits a politeness, which, flowing from
the heart rather than the head, delights all who have the
pleasure of his acquaintance, and renders him an acceptable
guest, and an agreeable companion.</p>

<p>There is a native openness and benevolence in his character,
which excite the love of all who know him, and
which powerfully attract the stranger as well as the friend.
He seems superior to the grovelling intrigues of party,
and always expresses his feelings, in the bold and lofty
language of conscious independence and freedom. There
is a marked difference between this gentleman and his
brother, Mr. Philip P. Barbour,<a name="FNanchor_123_20" id="FNanchor_123_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_20" class="fnanchor">123</a> a member of the House
of Representatives, in the respective faculties of their
mind; the latter is more logical, and also more laborious
and indefatigable. He seems to have a peculiar tact for
those constitutional and legal questions which [372] are
involved and obscure, and possesses that clearness and
vigor of mind necessary to unfold what is complicated,
and illuminate what is dark. He casts on such subjects
so powerful a light, that we wonder we should ever have
doubted, and behold at once the truth, stripped of all its
obscurity. The former seldom attempts an analysis of
such questions. He reasons, but his reasoning is not so
much that of a mathematician, as of an advocate who
labours to surprise by his novelty, and to fascinate by the
ingenuity of his deductions, and the ease and beauty of
his elocution. He has more genius than his brother, but
less judgment; more refinement and elegance, but less
vigor and energy. It appears to me that there is a vast
deal of what may be denominated <i>law mind</i> in this coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>try,
which will ultimately reach a point of excellence that
must astonish the world. The fondness for the profession
of the law, at present, is wonderful; almost every man,
whatever be his means of support, or grade in society, if
he have children, endeavours to make one of them, at
least, a disciple of Coke, or a "fomentor of village vexation,"
and you cannot enter a court-house, without being
astonished at the number of young men, who are either
studying or practising the law. This, however, is not a
matter of surprise, when we consider the facility with
which this profession leads to preferment and distinction,
and the ease with which it seems to be acquired. Amidst
such [373] a mass of <i>law mind</i>, therefore, as exists here,
excellence must hereafter be attained, if it has not now
reached its climax; and the Cokes, the Mansfields, and
Ellenboroughs of England are, or will soon be, equalled
in this country. The future destinies of this republic
cannot be fully anticipated; the march of mind is progressive
and resistless, and intellectual pre-eminence must
be attained where so many inducements are offered to
effect, and so few impediments exist to prevent it. Mind
is often regulated by the circumstance in which it is
placed, and fashioned by the objects by which it is surrounded.
This country is, therefore, peculiarly favorable
for the expansion and development of the intellectual
powers. Physical, as well as moral causes, operate to
this end. The eye of an American is perpetually presented
with an outline of wonderful magnificence and grandeur;
every work of nature is here on a vast and expansive scale;
the mountains, and lakes, and rivers, and forests, appear
in a wild sublimity of grandeur, which renders the mountains,
lakes, and rivers of Europe, mere pigmies in comparison.
The political and religious freedom, too, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is here experienced, removes all shackles, and gives an
elasticity, a loftiness, and an impetus to the mind that
cannot but propel it to greatness. Thus operated upon
by moral and physical causes, what must be the ultimate
destiny of the people of this country, and the range and
expansion of intellect which they [374] will possess?
Devoted as they are for the most part to studies and professions,
which have a tendency to enlarge and liberalize
the mind, and influenced by the causes I have mentioned,
it would be worse than stupidity to suppose they could
long remain an inferior people, or possibly avoid reaching
that point of elevation of which mankind are capable.
The <i>law mind</i> of this country has now attained a high
degree of splendor, and is in rapid progress to still greater
excellence. There are many men, in this country, though
so much calumniated by British writers, who would shed
a lustre on the bench of that nation, and not suffer by a
comparison with some of the brightest luminaries of English
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Before I quit this body of American worthies, I must
introduce to your acquaintance, as succinctly as possible,
another member of the senate, who, though not so conspicuous
as the two former, in the walks of public life, is
not inferior to any in this country, in all that constitutes
and dignifies the patriot and the statesman. Mr. Roberts
is from Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_124_21" id="FNanchor_124_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_21" class="fnanchor">124</a> He is a plain farmer, and was,
once, I understand, a mechanic. Though he cannot boast
of a liberal education, yet nature has given him a mind,
which, with early improvement, would have made him
prominent in any sphere in life. It is vigorous and
powerful in no ordinary degree, and the sophistry of art,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and the dexterity of learning, are often foiled and defeated
[375] by the unaided and spontaneous efforts of his native
good sense. But he has that which is of more sterling
advantage, both to himself and his country,&mdash;immoveable
political and moral integrity. It is gratifying, in this
age of corruption and voluptuousness, to contemplate
men like Aristides, Fabricius, and Cato. They exhibit
to us the true dignity of man, and hold out examples that
we must feel delighted to imitate. They show us to what
pitch of excellence man is capable of attaining, and
rescue the exalted condition of human nature from that
odium and disgrace which profligacy and corruption have
heaped upon it. No spectacle can be more sublime or
more elevating than he, who, in the hour of public danger
and trial, and amidst the allurements and fascinations of
vice, stands like a rock in the ocean, placid and immoveable,
and endures the dangers that surround, and braves
the storms and tempests that beat upon him, with undeviating
firmness, for the safety of his country and the
glory of his God! The mind rests upon such a character
as the eye upon a spot of fertility, amidst deserts of sand,
and we rise from the blood-stained page of history, and
the corruptions of the living world, with a heart filled with
love, admiration, and reverence, by the contemplation of
the few who have shed an imperishable lustre on the exalted
character of man. This description is not exaggerated;
it is drawn from nature and truth, and [376] fancy
has nothing to do with the picture. But I must now hasten
to finish my portraits of American characters.</p>

<p>Mr. Bagot,<a name="FNanchor_125_22" id="FNanchor_125_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_22" class="fnanchor">125</a> the English minister to this government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
appears to be about thirty-five years of age. He is tall,
elegant, and rather graceful in his person, with a countenance
open and ingenuous, an English complexion, and
eyes mild though dark. He has ingratiated himself with
the Americans, by the real or affected simplicity of his
manners, and by assimilating himself to their usages and
customs. He has thrown aside the reserve and hauteur
of the English character, as not at all suited to the meridian
of this country, and attends to all with equal courtesy and
politeness. I can say nothing of the powers of his mind,
but they do not appear to be more than ordinary. It has
always seemed to me very strange policy on the part of
the British cabinet, to appoint ministers to this country
of inferior capacity and inconsiderable reputation, while
the Americans send to our court only their most prominent
and leading men, who have distinguished themselves by
their ability and their eloquence.</p>

<p>The French minister, M. Hyde de Neuville,<a name="FNanchor_126_23" id="FNanchor_126_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_23" class="fnanchor">126</a> is a "fat,
portly gentleman," with a broad chest, big head, and short
neck, which he seems almost incapable of turning <i>ad libitum</i>.
He is full of [377] Bourbon importance and French
vivacity; has petits soupers every Saturday evening during
the winter, and spends his summer at the springs, or his
country residence, in extolling the virtues of his beloved
Louis <i>le desir&eacute;</i>. I do not think that M. Neuville, though
an amiable, and, I understand, a benevolent man, has
that kind of talent which would qualify him for the station
he holds, or that, in the event of any difficulty arising between
this country and France, he could counteract the
intrigues of diplomatic ingenuity, or benefit his nation,
by inducing the American cabinet, though I believe he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
highly esteemed, to adopt any measure not manifestly
advantageous to the United States. He has been many
years a resident of this country, and was driven from
France by the persecutions of Buonaparte. He is said to
have evinced for his exiled countrymen much feeling and
interest, and to have given them, while strangers and unknown
in a foreign land, all the aid he could afford. His
acts of benevolence certainly redound to the credit of his
heart, and I should be sorry to say any thing that would
disparage the qualities of his head. He is too much
occupied with his own, or other people's concerns, to
attend to the little or the complicated intrigues of courts,
and though he resides here as a representative, yet he now
represents a cypher.</p>

<p>[378] <i>4th</i>.&mdash;To tea with J. C. Wright, Esq., to meet a
young man, Mr. Dawson, who is giving up a school here
to go as "Teacher to the Cherokee nation of Indians."
Much enthusiasm takes him there; little will be needed
to bring him back again. Since my return, Washington
has been visited by some very distant and interesting
tribes of Indians, with the following account of whom I
have been favoured by a friend residing there.</p>


<p class="nblockquot"><i>Some account of the Indians who visited all the Chief Cities
in the Eastern States, and made a long stay in Washington
in the winter of 1821</i>.</p>

<p>These Indians were the chiefs and half-chiefs of tribes
from the most western part of this continent with which
we are at all acquainted, and came under the guid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ance
of Major O'Fallan<a name="FNanchor_127_24" id="FNanchor_127_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_24" class="fnanchor">127</a> from the Counsel Bluffs.<a name="FNanchor_128_25" id="FNanchor_128_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_25" class="fnanchor">128</a>
All of them were men of large stature, very muscular,
having fine open countenances, with the real noble Roman
nose, dignified in their manners, and peaceful and quiet
in their habits. There was no instance of drunkenness
among them during their stay here. The circumstances
which led to their visit were singular. A missionary, who
had been amongst them a few years back, on renewing his
visit recently, found an old chief, with whom he was acquainted,
degraded from his rank, and another appointed
in his place. This led to inquiries after the cause, which
proved to be that this chief having, during a considerable
[379] absence from his tribe, visited some of the cities of
the whites, carried back such a report of their houses,
ships, numbers, wealth, and power, that they disbelieved
his account, and degraded him as a man unworthy of
being longer their chief. They inquired of their missionaries,
who confirmed the statement, and they met in
council with other tribes, and resolved that a deputation
should, in company with the representative of the great
father, "see if things were so," and if they were, the chief
should be reinstated. They have returned, saying the
"half was not told them." Red Jacket<a name="FNanchor_129_26" id="FNanchor_129_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_26" class="fnanchor">129</a> (of whom you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
have heard) used to say, that "the great spirit was too
great a being to overlook red men; that he listened to the
talk of red men as well as to the talk of white men;" but
these natives of the forest thought the great spirit favoured
white men more than red. An anecdote is related of one
of the chiefs (a Pawnee) which is a well authenticated
fact, and recorded by Dr. Morse in his account of visits
to the western regions.<a name="FNanchor_130_27" id="FNanchor_130_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_27" class="fnanchor">130</a> The tribe of the Pawnees had
taken a woman prisoner from a neighbouring tribe with
whom they were at war, and, as was their custom, they
made every preparation to offer her a sacrifice to the great
spirit. Every thing was prepared, the wood, the green
withes, and the fire, and the victim, when this chief suddenly
flew and seized her, carried her under his arm to a
neighbouring thicket, where [380] he had prepared horses
for her and himself, and riding away at speed, he, after
three days' travelling through the woods, returned her in
safety to her tribe and friends. This event was considered
by the Pawnee tribe as an interference of the great
spirit in her favour, and on the return of the chief no questions
were asked him on that subject, nor has a woman been
offered a sacrifice by that tribe since. As a compliment
justly due to his gallant exploit, a number of ladies in this
city had a medal made, and presented to him in due form,
in the presence of all the Indians; on one side of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was represented the preparation for the sacrifice, and on
the reverse the chief running off with a woman under his
arm, and two horses stationed at a short distance, surmounted
by this inscription, "To the bravest of the
Braves," (the Pawnees are also called the Braves). These
Indians excited so much interest from their dignified personal
appearance, and from their peaceful manner, that
they received a great number of rich presents, sufficient
to fill six large boxes in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
and Washington; these were forwarded before they
left us. Their portraits, which are gone with them, were
taken in oil by Mr. King in their native costume, buffalo
skins, with the hair inside, turned back at the neck and
breast, which looked very handsome, like fur collars.
Eight, however, the chiefs and [381] the squaw, Mr. King
copied and keeps himself.<a name="FNanchor_131_28" id="FNanchor_131_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_28" class="fnanchor">131</a> He received 400 dollars
from <i>Uncle Sam</i> for it. There was a notice in the papers
that the Indians would dance and display their feats in
front of the President's house on a certain day, which they
did to at least 6,000 persons. They shewed their manner
of sitting in council, their dances, their war whoop, with
the noises, gesticulations, &amp;c. of the centinels on the sight
of an approaching enemy. They were in a state of perfect
nudity, except a piece of red flannel round the waist
and passing between the legs. They afterwards performed
at the house of his Excellency M. Hyde de Neuville.
They were painted horribly, and exhibited the operation
of scalping and tomahawking in fine style.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The Otta half-chief<a name="FNanchor_132_29" id="FNanchor_132_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_29" class="fnanchor">132</a> and his squaw have taken tea
with and frequently visited us. She was a very good
natured, mild woman, and he shewed great readiness in
acquiring our language, being inquisitive, retaining any
thing that he was once informed, and imitating admirably
the tones of every word. He spent the evening with us
before they finally left the city. I took himself and squaw
into Dr. Barber's room, and opened gently the skeleton
case. He looked slyly in, and the wife wanted to look, but
he put himself in an attitude to represent a dead person,
and said, "<i>no good, no good</i>." She still wanted to see,
but he would [382] not let her. Three others came afterwards
wanting to see it, who, when I opened it, raised
themselves up in a dignified manner and said, "<i>very good</i>,"
one of them taking hold of the hand said, "how you do."<a name="FNanchor_133_30" id="FNanchor_133_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_30" class="fnanchor">133</a>
The Otta half-chief and squaw afterwards saw it together
and were very well pleased. Our children were all full
of play with them, and the squaw nursed the younger ones.
Margaret wanted to go with them. The calumet<a name="FNanchor_134_31" id="FNanchor_134_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_31" class="fnanchor">134</a> of
peace (the tomahawk pipe and their own sumach tobacco)
frequently went round, and they expressed a wish to see
us again.</p>

<p>I have recorded much of the vocabulary of these Indians,
and would transcribe it, but have not room. They count
by tens as we do, for instance, <i>noah</i>, two; <i>taurny</i>, three;
<i>crabraugh</i>, ten; <i>crabraugh noah</i>, twenty; <i>crabraugh taurny</i>,
thirty, &amp;c. They hold polygamy as honourable; one
wife, <i>no good</i>; three, <i>good</i>; four, <i>very good</i>. In their talks
with the residents they shew no wish to adopt our habits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;To dine with Dr. Dawes at his poor, worn out
farm, of which he is already tired. The Doctor seems
one of the best Englishmen I have met in America.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 6th.</i>&mdash;Dr. Rice<a name="FNanchor_135_32" id="FNanchor_135_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_32" class="fnanchor">135</a> preaching this day in Congress-hall
before the senate, and representatives, [383]
called the assembly, polite, just, respected, respectable,
and deemed it unnecessary to mention sin and human
depravity.</p>

<p>American husbands abound in outward politeness
and respect to their wives; and gentlemen, in general,
are excessively attentive to the fair sex, rising and leaving
their seats, even at church, to accommodate the late
coming ladies. I gave much offence, on a recent occasion,
by my want of gallantry in this particular. The
meanest white woman is here addressed by the title of
<i>Madam</i>.</p>

<p>It may also be mentioned, as a proof of superior civilization
and refinement in manners, that a stranger cannot,
in this country, enter and join a party or social circle,
without being publicly presented by name, and exchanging
names and hearty shakes of the hand with all present.
Should he, however, happen to enter and take his seat
without submitting to this indispensable ceremony, he
must remain dumb and unnoticed, as an intruder, or as
a person whose character renders him unfit for introduction,
and for the acquaintance of any. But, on the other
hand, when properly presented, he is instantly at home;
and ever after, at any distance of time and place, acknowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>edged
as entitled to the goodwill and friendship of all who
thus met him. Friendships are thus formed and propagated,
and the boundaries of society in the new world extended.
It would hence be impracticable for me to be
half an hour, as has happened to me in England, [384]
unknowingly present with a person of distinction; and
many unpleasant mistakes and misunderstandings are
thus obviated.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;I heard Mr. Speaker Clay deliver a splendid
speech of four hours long on the Missouri slave-question.
His voice fills the house; his action is good and generally
graceful.</p>

<p>I met this evening Mr. Smith, a young gentleman from
Lincolnshire, the fellow-traveller of Mr. Parr, who walked
through the west, and admired all! He is not determined
on continuing here; he has a good farm in England. He
and Mr. Parr have been introduced by a member of Congress
to the President, who sat half an hour familiarly
talking with them, in a plain, domestic, business-like
manner.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 13th.</i>&mdash;From the Speaker's chair in Congress-hall,
I heard the young, learned, and reverend professor
Everett, of Cambridge University, (aged 29) preach most
eloquently to the President and legislature of this great
empire.<a name="FNanchor_136_33" id="FNanchor_136_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_33" class="fnanchor">136</a> His voice, bewitchingly melodious, yet manly,
filled the house, and made every word tell, and every ear
hear. "<i>Time is short</i>," was the subject. His discourse
was full of high praise of this land, it being, he said, (in
my own language) "the only resting place for liberty, who,
when driven hence, must ascend in her pure, white robes
to heaven. No more new continents will be discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
for her reception, and therefore let this nation wisely [385]
keep her asylum here." He then spoke very warmly
against kings, lords, and priests, and what he called the
toleration of man and his rights. "In England they
tolerate liberty; and what is liberty there? A shadow!
But here, a substance! There her existence is only
nominal. She is mocked by her very name." Independent
of its moral instruction, this sermon was a fine specimen
of oratory, and greatly interested the members of
both houses, who very cordially shook the preacher by
the hand. Though not forgetting slavery in his discourse,
the professor seemed too partial to it.</p>

<p>This gentleman had just returned from his tour through
Europe, where he visited Sir Walter Scott, and other distinguished
literati, and preached in London.</p>

<p>I met Mr. Lowndes, the Howard of America, at Mr.
Elliott's. He says, that "Harmony presents much moral
philosophy in practice. Flesh and blood had hard work
at first, but now they have but few desires to gratify.
Nature seems under the hatches, and they have little to
wish, want, or fear. But theirs is a stagnant life."</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Read Mr. John Wright's pamphlet on Slavery,
in which he uses my name in reference to my negro letter,
and shows very clearly the evil effects of slavery on the
character of this country, and proves the unalterable
nature of the black man's right to liberty, and its
benefits.</p>

<p>[386] Mr. Rufus King, a member for New York, a
gentlemanly English-like speaker, confines himself to
business, and to the grand fundamental principles of every
political question, and the consequences likely to result
from extending slavery over the continent. "In time,"
says he, "you will enable the blacks to enslave the whites.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Why, therefore, should we of the free, be compelled to
suffer with you of the slave states?"</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;I supped with Dr. Alison,<a name="FNanchor_137_34" id="FNanchor_137_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_34" class="fnanchor">137</a> Chaplain to Congress,
a gentleman possessing every variety of knowledge.
He is the friend and correspondent of the Ex-presidents
Jefferson and Adams, and of the present President, and
is known all over the country by his virtues. This gentleman
was visited by the black Baron de Vasey, and his
friend, from St. Domingo, who supped with him. On
their quitting the room, the doctor's black servant set up a
laugh, which might be heard by the baron, and all, far
and near. "What's the matter, Sam?" said the doctor.
"Why, two niggers sat and took tea with my massa, at
the same table!!" In Virginia, the doctor complained of
his fears of being murdered by the negroes, one hundred
of whom were owned by his hostess. She cried and said,
"she hoped the Lord would protect her." "Oh, no! you
must not look to the Lord for it; it is not there." She
said she would free them, if she could find any body to
support them. Freed slaves must quit the states, or be
sold by it for slaves again! [387] Colonel Taylor has a
black uncle, a slave, for his body guard, and most owners
are related to their black cattle. A gentleman of Washington,
too kind-hearted to whip his house-negroes himself,
leaves it to his wife, a fashionable, beautiful female, holding,
and going to levees, yet able to cow-hide her negroes,
whose screams, under the lash, scare Mrs. Little and family.
A cow-hide is no uncommon appendage of ladies here!</p>

<p>Squire Simpson, an old emigrant from England, whom
I have before mentioned as living near this city, once acted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
as a magistrate. Two parties came before him for justice,
but neither of them seemed disposed to submit to his worship's
decision. At last, the most choleric of the two thus
addressed Mr. Simpson: "Well! I don't see, I guess, that
we can settle it fairly. So here's at you. I'll fight you,
Squire!" Both then went out, magistrate and man, and
decided the affair by battle. Simpson was victor.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Revisited Dr. Dawes, who is full of improving
his farm by a summer fallow, and turning it into grass
without a crop. He has paid only half the cash for his
farm of 500 acres, because the title cannot be completed.
Any one, says ex-squire Simpson, would take it off his
hands. The doctor deems, as does Sir H. Davy, that
plaster of Paris is the natural food of plants; and it is
found, more or less, in almost all soils, particularly in
England, [388] where manuring with plaster is found to
have but little effect, but in this country vice vers&acirc;.</p>

<p>Visited Mr. Plant, who holds 400 acres, all cleared and
enclosed long ago, and exhausted too, at 100 dollars a year
rent, offered for sale at fifteen dollars an acre, poor but
useful, light, sandy loam, shining bright with silvery mica.
He manages this estate without a capital, by the labour of
himself, one slave and a boy; he hires none. He has sold
Bradford's Rest, a large estate, costing seven dollars, for
20 dollars per acre; well sold!</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;I rode this day to the bench of his worship,
Squire Arden, with Doctor Dawes, who was served with
a warrant for a small debt for goods. I carried the Doctor's
diploma, to prove him a physician, authorized to
write prescriptions. The plaintiff is a neighbour of the
Doctor's, who had prescribed for his family, and therefore
pleaded a set off. The plaintiff then swore he would
prove that the Doctor never was sent for nor came! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Doctor considers almost all here as unprincipled and conspiring
against his cash. Quitting the diploma for the
plough, he gave up a practice of 400 or 500 pounds a year,
at Wisbeach, in England, where he was highly esteemed.
His humanity here to poor exiles, distinguishes him as a
patriot and a philanthropist, and entitles him to the applause
and goodwill of all mankind. In September last,
poor John Steed, the English Quaker, [389] was fed,
housed, physicked, and restored to health, by this benevolent
man. Steed was returning to England; but how
to return without money? There was money for him!
My warm-hearted friend, <i>the watchman</i>, a dear friend of
the Rev. I. Leathes, brother-in-law of the late Bishop of
Bristol, put into Steed's empty hands a purse, amply
sufficient for his land and sea expenses. This was noble!
It is well to praise man for his humanity to a suffering
brother, but better to ascribe all the glory to his Maker,
who gives all, and blesses him with a generous heart, and
who has promised that "He who deviseth liberal things,
by liberal things shall he stand."</p>

<p><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;I revisited the astronomical, mathematical,
and philosophical Mr. W. Elliott, dining on vegetables
only. He states that it is impossible for a sensible, honest
Englishman to prefer this country to his own; and in
knowing that he has quitted England for ever, he experiences
a feeling indescribably painful. To return no more
is a word next to death. Although he would not, at present,
desire to live in England, yet he would not advise any
to quit who can live in it. The soil here is unfit for man,
and for an Englishman particularly. Both mind and
body barbarize and degenerate. He feels, at first, sanguine,
but soon after he begins to judge and compare, and
finds that though the government allured him here, yet
that all is not gold that glitters. He becomes [390] weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and emaciated, and drifts into the habits of the country,
where he is no longer the man he thought himself at first.
The labouring poor here are far behind, and more miserable
than the poor, bold peasantry of England. No
man needs labour here long, if he would work and not
drink excessively; but he drinks and is undone.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 12th.</i>&mdash;Met J. G. Wright, Esq. who has consumed,
in segars, for his own use, since he began smoking,
twenty years since, 700 barrels of flour, at the present price.
One hundred and fifty dollars annually is the cost of his
smoking.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;The Hon. T. Law brought, it is said, half a
million sterling with him to this country, but has lost two-thirds
of it. He married the niece of General Washington,
the most beautiful lady in Virginia; and, at her uncle's
request, Mr. Law settled on her, in case they parted,
15,000 dollars a year. The event, which seemed thus to
be anticipated, soon after occurred; for Mr. Law visiting
England soon after his marriage and leaving his wife in
America, she, during his absence, eloped with a young
dashing officer in the army. Mr. Law returned only to
part with one of the most accomplished ladies in the land.
She still lives in high style, and her house is the resort of
the most fashionable parties.<a name="FNanchor_138_35" id="FNanchor_138_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_35" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>By Mr. Sutton, an English gentleman from Cheshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
I was this day introduced to an hour's conversation with
Mr. John Law, a lawyer of this [391] city, son of Mr.
Thomas Law, above mentioned. This gentleman occupies
a mean office, but seems very sprightly and acute,
and though a plain republican, has much of the blood of
the Laws in him. He states that he is in expectation of
receiving 80,000<i>l.</i> from Sir Wm. T&mdash;&mdash;, for purchasing
land in the wilds of the west, which is to increase in value
greatly in twenty years. For the same purpose, he also
wishes to get 150,000<i>l.</i> from English capitalists, who never
mean to emigrate, but who only wish to invest money in
western lands. There are several millions of acres, some
of which, military lands in Illinois, are selling at 37 and
50 cents an acre. Mr. Law proposes to be the agent, and
live on the spot, to settle poor emigrants from England
on it, by finding them implements and money for commencing,
which is to be repaid in produce. They are to
live seven years rent free. He would make it his business
to interest emigrant societies in favor of this speculation,
by which the posterity of such capitalists are to benefit
greatly. Mr. Law is to receive only one quarter of the
cash for his own trouble, that is, <i>only</i> about 37,000<i>l.</i> or
40,000<i>l.</i> out of the 150,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Birkbeck (he says) must be rich in ten years; which ten
years of life he admits a man must sacrifice before he can
arrive at <i>comforts</i>. Ohio, he states, has proved what time
can do for a wilderness; and I say, that time has proved
that those [392] enriching improvements made by hands,
and not by time, can be bought any where for less than
they cost in that State, or almost in any other, Kentucky
perhaps excepted.</p>

<p><i>A reflection or two on litigation!</i>&mdash;The Judges here
have not legal knowledge enough for their station; and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
course not weight of character or dignity sufficient to fill
it well. Counsellor Jones and Key, of "<i>star-spangled
banner</i>" fame, influence, and carry their honours almost
as they please.<a name="FNanchor_139_36" id="FNanchor_139_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_36" class="fnanchor">139</a> The bar is greater than the bench!</p>

<p>Litigation frequently arises here from the imaginary
independence which one man has, or fancies he has of
others, to show which, on the least slip, a suit is the certain
result. It is bad for the people that law is cheap, as it
keeps them constantly in strife with their neighbours,
and annihilates that sociability of feeling which so strongly
characterizes the English. From the constant litigation
amongst the people of this country arise that antisocial
apathy, and want of those kindly feelings of the heart,
which shew themselves on all occasions, in the conduct
and character of the people of the old country. There
were more suits for debt in Washington county court, in
a late term, (seventeen hundred), than, perhaps, in all
England! Further comments are left to the reader.</p>

<p>Judge Parsons, while only an advocate, completely upset
the evidence against a prisoner who employed him,
and that in the following manner. [393] The witnesses
against the prisoner were all sailors. The advocate disguised
himself as a sailor, and offered to bet them twenty
dollars that the accused would not be hanged. They
readily accepted the bet, and when they came, over anxious
to give evidence and convict the prisoner at the bar,
the learned counsel confounded them with their bet, the
court spurned their evidence, and the prisoner, though
guilty, escaped by this learned stratagem. At another
time, in an important case of law, where several parties
were interested, he was requested to plead, he said, "No!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
I cannot see my way clear." They then offered him 1,000
dollars for his neutrality, which he took. The other side
then came. "No," said he, as before. "Well then,"
said they, "if you will not plead for us, we will give you
1,000 dollars not to be against us;" which sum he took,
and left other advocates to talk.</p>

<p>Edward C&mdash;&mdash;, late in the service of Joseph Vipan,
Esq. of Sutton, is here elevated from the smock frock and
stable, to the dress and society of a merchant in this city.
So great is the change and so mighty the tyranny of custom,
that what were his duties last year, would now be a
disgrace to him. Another would-be gentleman, in the
same store, was requested to assist his employer, a polished
Englishman, in rolling a barrel of dried fish out of the
cellar into a cart only. "Oh! no, that is <i>nigger's</i> work,"
said he; and then left a good situation within two hours
after [394] he came to it. Such are the blessed effects of
slavery!</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;Met Mr. Cooper, an English gentleman, at
Washington, who has grown comfortable rich, and has
recently bought about 300 acres of land, near this city, so
exhausted, that no produce can be had from it for years
to come. The system pursued here, if carried into the
old country, would soon lay it waste, more effectually than
either fire or sword. It is more difficult to raise a hundred
dollars here than a hundred pounds in England. Individuals,
who are rich in land, are generally without cash,
and have their personalty seized, and sold for small debts,
of a few dollars only.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;All kinds of fruit and vegetables (potatoes excepted)
are now remarkably scarce, and enormously dear,
insomuch that they are not seen, during the winter and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
spring, except on the tables of the rich. In summer they
cost as much or more than butcher's meat; yet thousands
of acres, all round the city, close to water and manure,
are to be had by any body free of rent! In summer the
potatoes were one dollar fifty cents per bushel; now, eastern
potatoes sell for 50 to 75 cents, and nothing but potatoes
come on the tables of the bulk of the people. What
is the cause? "Why," says one, "the gardeners get rich
and ride in their single horse chaise, because the business
is so profitable. They have no competition. [395] Whatever
they send to market is sold only at their own price.
It is their will to have 150 per cent, above the value of an
article. Rather than undersell, they would carry home
their vegetables for the cattle and pigs!" So that the
will of the gardener governs the price, although the means
of opposition are open to all! The poor farmer comes to
market with his flour, but <i>his</i> will is to take just what is
offered him. He is not in the gardener's secret of insisting
and willing to have ten dollars a barrel for flour, when
worth only four dollars and a half. But what is the real
cause of the high price of vegetables in this soil and climate
of Washington? Why, no body gardens; not even the
rich; because they can buy cheaper than they can raise
them; and it is found that none but the poor, humble man,
who has no capital, will attempt it, because others can
employ capital more profitably than in gardening. It is
therefore an undoubted fact, that the soil and climate do
not admit of vegetables being raised, at a much lower
price than that at which they are actually sold. In summer,
continual watering and shading are absolutely necessary,
and the soil is poor into the bargain; insomuch that
the seed rises so weak, that the sun would burn up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
plants instantly, without great attention to shade and
watering, and if this were not so, myriads of grasshoppers
would eat all in spite of any measures for their preservation.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>&mdash;Commodore Stephen Decatur<a name="FNanchor_140_37" id="FNanchor_140_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_37" class="fnanchor">140</a> fell this day in
a duel, having killed five men in the same way himself.
He swore shamefully at the doctors while dying, because
they could not extract the fatal ball from his bowels. He
is called by the National Intelligencer, "One of the bright
stars of Columbia, set for ever!" And the country is
summoned to mourn for him. The president and the
heads of departments, with military and naval officers
and citizens, walked in procession at his funeral. The
laws of heaven and earth, on this subject, are here quite
insulted, by common consent. A lady of this district,
hearing that her husband was gone to fight a duel, fifty
miles off, sent an express, charging that he should be
brought home a corpse rather than disgraced. It is a
rule here always to take skilful aim, and if one party
chooses to reserve his fire, he may go up and shoot the
other, if he does not beg for his life. [397] A gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
once would not beg it, but the other said, "If your life is
not worth asking for, it is not worth taking!" And so
fired in the air.</p>

<p>A sinecure, or something in the nature of one, is held
by Joseph Paulding, Esq. of Washington.<a name="FNanchor_141_38" id="FNanchor_141_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_38" class="fnanchor">141</a> The holder
of this situation is enjoined to write in defence of the
American character and government, and at the same
time to vilify the British. Mr. Colvin, late editor of the
National Register, in a critique on Lancaster's lectures,
says, "that we (meaning America) are more virtuous
than the people of other nations, I cannot believe. It is
sufficient that we are equal, not worse." That there is
no great superiority of moral worth on the part of America,
the following anecdote will prove. A gentleman seduced
the sister of his own wife, and then, to hide her disgrace,
disguised his wife in the uniform of a lieutenant of the
United States' navy, and married the young woman to
her. The lieutenant of course went to sea immediately,
and, poor man! was never heard of more. The nuptials
were celebrated by candle-light, and all the gay company,
except the priest, were parties to this ingenious trick!</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Flour now is only four dollars and a half a barrel,
five bushels to a barrel. After hauling, grinding, and
the cost of the empty barrel, are deducted, it is seen that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the farmer only receives two dollars fifty cents, for five
bushels of fine wheat. Under such circumstances, where
is profit?</p>

<p>[398] <i>Sunday, 26th.</i>&mdash;I left this city and old friends, to
return, perhaps, no more. At Baltimore, on my way to
Philadelphia, I met Joseph Lancaster, teaching a few small
children.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Again at Philadelphia, where British and
French goods are selling at 200 per cent. under cost. So
great is the distress for money, that the regular merchants
are sending their stock to auction. I visited Mr. Potter,
an English merchant, who has been established here ever
since the peace of 1786. He is now rich, but loves England
still. He was intimately known to the Duke of Kent.
He says that corruption is rising into an English sense,
even here; and adding the state and general taxes together,
they make a sum little short of English taxation.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Six hundred prisoners are this day in a state of
mutiny, endeavouring to escape by violence from the
Philadelphia state prison. One is shot, and three or
four are wounded. The mail robbers now in custody
killed the driver of the mail, but they have restored all
the money, and pray that they may not be hanged.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;I parted with my old friend C., who promised
to meet me again at Baltimore, in June. I reached Newcastle,
Delaware State, and visited its old Golgotha, on
a bluff, near the river Delaware, which washes the feet
of the dead, exposes a great part of the coffin, and bleaches
the skulls and bones of men. Numbers of horses tread
on the [399] graves and break in the coffins, for here is
nothing to protect these bones from insult.</p>

<p>I saw the effect of the late freezing rain on the trees,
which, over an extent of country six times as large as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
England, has despoiled trees as completely as if chain
shot had passed through them all. The trees and shrubs
are laden with ice, a weight ten times that of their own
boughs. Many farmers lost nearly all their timber and
orchards: a ship also was upset by the great weight of
the ice adhering to her rigging.</p>

<p><i>April 7th.</i>&mdash;I met with a black gentleman who has
bought a beautiful farm, with a good house and improvements,
six miles only from Philadelphia, at twenty dollars
an acre, at a sheriff's sale. A law has just passed to prevent
any more selling under two thirds of a fair valuation.
A quaker whom I met, states that Joseph Lancaster
injured himself by going to Baltimore. He did not succeed
at Philadelphia, the only place where he could have
succeeded, because he expected more attention from the
inhabitants of that city, than they ever pay to any body.</p>

<p>Visited Peale's museum,<a name="FNanchor_142_39" id="FNanchor_142_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_39" class="fnanchor">142</a> a fine collection of native
and foreign curiosities, amongst the former of which are
the skeleton of a mammoth, 15 feet high, and horns, nine
feet long, under the belly of which, as under an arch, a
horse might run full gallop. I crept down the throat of
an alligator. [400] Several bodies of Indian chiefs are
here to be seen dried, standing in their usual dresses and
attitudes, as well as some Otaheiteans.<a name="FNanchor_143_40" id="FNanchor_143_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_40" class="fnanchor">143</a> There is also
the skin from the thighs and legs of an Indian, tanned by
Indians into fine leather, for thus they use their prisoners
taken in battle. I saw the manuscript of a poem of Major
Andr&eacute;, penned about two months before his execution.<a name="FNanchor_144_41" id="FNanchor_144_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_41" class="fnanchor">144</a>
Here is also a fine collection of national portraits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;I this day set sail from Philadelphia for Charleston,
in the <i>General Wade Hampton</i>, and anchored at Newcastle
in the evening.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 9th.</i>&mdash;I rode with the captain, in his chariot,
to the beautiful seat and extensive powder mills of E. S.
Dupont, Esq.<a name="FNanchor_145_42" id="FNanchor_145_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_42" class="fnanchor">145</a> on the Brandywine creek, a fine stream
full of natural falls and working many mills. We went
for 500 barrels of gunpowder. Mr. Dupont, who pressingly
invited us to dine, seems a liberal, intelligent Frenchman,
of large capital, which sometimes vanishes by explosion,
together with the doors and windows of his elegant
mansion.</p>

<p>During this twenty miles ride, I observed that thorn quicks
are here generally used as an outward fence, but
they are badly managed. I saw, on poor wet lands,
large heaps of lime, formed by oyster shells and stone,
gathered and burnt for manure; in this way cheaply turning
stone into bread.</p>

<p>We received this evening three or four physicians [401]
and other passengers, to the number of ten or twelve, on
board the <i>Wade Hampton</i>.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;At three, this morning, we got under weigh,
sailing into the bay of Delaware, and by noon arrived
opposite to the light-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>A family (says the Captain) from England, of the name
of Clementson, recently bought an estate from a scoundrel
old countryman, of the name of Watson, living at
Philadelphia, at a price 200 or 300 per cent. above its
value. They paid in part about 6,000 dollars, but being
unable to pay the remainder, and having no written
contract, he induced them to quit and go to the wilds of
Ohio, where, he said, he had much land at a low price,
which they should have for the money in his hand. He
also kindly gave them a letter of credit to his agent there;
but on arriving, they found that he was unknown, and had
no land, nor agent; and they were in consequence forced
to sell their horses, waggon, and every necessary, to enable
them, in unspeakable distress, to return to prosecute
this scoundrel; but they had no evidence against him, and
therefore found it advisable to lose their money without
going to law. Having about 2,000 dollars left, they purchased
and stocked a farm bigger and better than the one
for which they were to have paid 8,000, or 10,000 dollars.
Old countrymen, it is said, make the most complete rascals.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Now at sea, exposed to head-winds and sea-sickness.
An Irish gentleman from Missouri, [402] states
that last week, on board the steam-boat, he met a black
archbishop and several of his inferior clergy. This most
reverend father in God was endeavouring to prove that
Adam, Noah, and all the prophets, and patriarchs, down
to Jesus Christ, were blacks, and that a small portion of
mankind, and that the worst, are whites, of whom Cain
is the progenitor.</p>

<p>The Missouri Irishman has invested 50,000 dollars in
land, the advantages of which he deems to be yet dubious
and prospective. He says that society is bad, and that
the people are unprincipled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Two old German gentlemen, heroes of the revolution,
now on board, state, that they knew the accomplished
and unfortunate Major Andr&eacute;. When taken by
three militiamen, in the capacity of a British spy, endeavouring
to seduce West Point, he was dressed as a
citizen, instead of appearing in the regimentals of his country,
which greatly aggravated his crime. He offered his
gold watch and purse, and large pecuniary compensation
to be released, but the three men were firm. Both sides
regretted, and were unwilling to witness, his death; and
the American government would have saved him, if the
British would have given up the traitor Arnold. He was
fairly tried, and no precipitation evinced towards him.
He thanked the court martial for their gentlemanly treatment,
submitted to his fate as a matter of course, and [403]
with great firmness prepared himself for it. Three months
elapsed between his apprehension and execution. But
when he was led out to execution, and saw the gallows
instead of the rifle, his firmness, in some measure, forsook
him. He was elegantly dressed in his martial suit, and on
giving his cravat to his waiting man, only said, "I die for
the honour of my king and country;" at which General
Green, the American commander, who presided in the
midst of the surrounding army on this sad occasion, shook
his head, and observed, "No! you die for your cowardice,
and like a coward!"</p>

<p>General Washington signed the order for his death with
great reluctance; but the army were dissatisfied and demanded
the sacrifice. The example was necessary and
salutary, and in its general consequence calculated to
deter men of honour and respectability from such military
meanness. Major Andr&eacute; hoped to the last to escape.
The tories, of whom he was one, had previously murdered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
some of the citizens and officers, in consequence of which,
General Washington determined on retaliation by executing
one of the British tory officers then prisoners, and
ordered them to draw lots to decide who of their number
must die. The lot fell on Sir Charles Asgill, who, but for
the French influence of Count Vergennes, and a most
pathetic letter from the baronet's mother, would have
been executed.<a name="FNanchor_146_43" id="FNanchor_146_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_43" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>[404] The quakers, about New Jersey, were very loyal,
and locked up the wells, and withheld all aid from the
rebels!</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 16th.</i>&mdash;Fine breeze; sailing by Cape Hatteras,
to pass which occupied two days. A strong current of
air is here found, rushing to the land, accompanied generally
with tempestuous gales. A gap in the Allegany
mountains, towards which this current rushes, is said to
be the cause.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;At three o'clock this afternoon I landed at
Charleston, and found all nature in its most beautiful
attire. Peas and all kinds of summer vegetables are in
great abundance, and the peach-trees full of fruit. I
found that my much respected friend, N. Russell, Esq.
had died only a fortnight since; he kindly inquired after
me in his extremity.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;I met my old shipmate, Mr. Moses Wood. I
bought twilled nankeen trowsers for two dollars and a
half. London clothes of good and best kinds sell at lower
prices than in London.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rattlesnakes.</i>&mdash;A gentleman informed me that he once
shot a rattlesnake as thick as his thigh, and 26 years
old. Its age is known by its tail. It was near biting him.
A neighbour of his left his house in search of his swine,
and being long away, his wife went after him and found
him dead, killed by a snake, to the bite of which the poor
deceased had applied a quid of tobacco, then found sticking
on the wound. Another neighbour, [405] who was
also bitten, managed to walk home before he fell, but died
very soon after his arrival. I was told, also, of a planter,
out with his dogs and rifle after a deer, which he shot;
but on bringing it to lay on the horse, a rattlesnake struck
the man, who was found dead, with the buck and horse,
which being tied to a tree was starved to death. Thus
they were all found dead in one heap together.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;By conversation with Judge King, to whom I
presented J. Wright's pamphlet on slavery, I learn that
my negro case was much noticed, and its exposure much
and indignantly regretted. Mr. King says that it was
indiscreet in me to report facts, except from the evidence
of my own senses! If no testimony is to be received, but
that of our own eyes, half the evidence in the world is
worthless. The Carolinians love slavery, and hate all who
hate it. Both Mr. King and Mr. Duncan state, that in
consequence of that affair, and of my being a foreigner,
a stranger in a strange land, if Gregory should prosecute
me for an advertisement, which I found it necessary, in
pursuing the claims on the Rugeley property, to publish
against him, I should meet with but little mercy from the
jury!</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Called on Patrick Duncan, Esq., and took a
final leave of him and his beautiful gardens, in which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
oranges, figs, sugar-canes, pomegranates, and the prairie
grass of South America, soft as silk in hand.</p>

<p>[406] Received, from my warm-hearted Irish friend,
Mr. Wood, 50 dollars, an unsolicited loan, although he
knows me not. Here is faith, greater than almost any
I have yet found in America.</p>

<p>The slave-owners, in this state, must maintain all their
helpless and infirm slaves, or kill them privately. They
cannot become chargeable to the parish, or state. O
humanity, where art thou!!! As a punishment for the
lassitude of age, or the idleness of youth, a <i>nigger</i> is
stripped naked, well flogged, then dressed all over with
treacle (or molasses) and hung up by his heels on a tree,
in a swamp full of flies and mosquitoes, which lick up the
sweets, and sting and bleed him dreadfully into the bargain.
He is then a living lump of inflammation. What
ingenious torture this! how refined! how honourable
to the taste and ingenuity of a nation, the freest of the
free, and who boast of superabundant polish and civilization!</p>

<p>When with my cousin, Major Rugely, in May last, I
was presented with a beautiful black female baby, that
could just creep, and which was given and intended to be
sent as a keepsake to my lady in England; but I, not being
qualified for a nurse at sea, nor indeed by land, declined
this well-intended gift. The Major then possessed a poor
negro, who wishing to die, was constantly detected in the
act of eating dirt or lumps of earth, a habit which procured
for him a cow-hiding daily! I might have had him, and
branded him with my own [407] brand, F. As cattle it
is necessary so to distinguish one herd from another, and
if they stray, or are stolen, to advertise their persons, cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>rectly
describing the mark, or brand, which is deeply
burnt in, and never obliterated, unless it is cut out!</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 23rd.</i>&mdash;I bade, this morning, a willing and final
farewell to Charleston city, and to all its bugs, mosquitoes,
negroes, and alligators, and a race of people, many of
whom seem not much better than they. I left behind me
some copies of J. Wright's pamphlet on slavery, for his
Excellency, Governor Geddiss, the Attorney-General
Haines, the editor of the Courier, Mr. Thomas Mitchel,
and Mr. Judge King, the latter of whom promised to keep
his a profound secret. The press seems here to be more
enslaved than under the most despotic government. At
night I found myself at sea, 60 miles from Charleston, in
the <i>President</i> for New York. Fare, 25 dollars.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;I saw two young alligators emigrating to the
north. Mr. Morse (the son of the geographer, Dr.
Morse)<a name="FNanchor_147_44" id="FNanchor_147_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_44" class="fnanchor">147</a> states, that at New Haven University, Connecticut,
an education of four years costs only 1,000 dollars,
board included. The same gentleman states, that in Connecticut,
republicanism and equality exist in greater
purity than in any other part of the union. The farmers
and people generally live economically and comfortably,
surrounded with a cheap abundance of all the [408] necessaries
of life, but they keep no domestic servants, male or
female. They are their own servants. As to negroes,
scarcely one is to be seen in a day's travel. The people
generally are so well educated in this state, that almost
any man is qualified for a schoolmaster in any of the sister
states. Dr. Paley's moral philosophy is a text book in
their college.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;A young gentleman on board, from the state of
Albania, says that Mobile, out of 600, lost 530 inhabitants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
by the yellow fever last summer. In winter the population
is from 2 to 3,000.</p>

<p>A dashing English gentleman travelling through this
state with a white servant behind him, rode up to a one-room
log-tavern, and begged the landlord to let him have
a room to himself, which was agreed to. In a few minutes
up came two native travellers, <i>equals</i>, who entered without
ceremony, when the Englishman began to curse the landlord
for permitting the intrusion. He replied, that he
meant that the gentleman should have the room to himself
until other travellers came up.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;At ten this morning we made Sandyhook light-house.
The scenery here, all the way up to the city of
New York, is delightful. Perhaps the views presented
by this city and neighbourhood are unequalled, both as
it respects the beauties of nature and the works of art. I
landed at six o'clock, and was introduced by Messrs.
Morse [409] and Co. to the boarding-house of Mrs.
Mudge, where I met Mr. Dwight, a brother of the late
eminent Dr. Dwight, now editor of the New York Advertiser.<a name="FNanchor_148_45" id="FNanchor_148_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_45" class="fnanchor">148</a>
In person this gentleman is said to be much like
the Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 30th.</i>&mdash;I accompanied Mr. Morse to the splendid
Presbyterian church of the eloquent Dr. Romaine,<a name="FNanchor_149_46" id="FNanchor_149_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_46" class="fnanchor">149</a>
whose prayers are the most appropriate in manner and
matter, and whose sermons are, with the exception of Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Storton's, superior to any I have heard in America. On
this day, the appearance of this large city is most orderly
and christian-like. This laudable change is attributed to
Sunday-schools. All places of worship are thronged.
How unlike Washington city! Mr. Morse states that not
only in New York, but in all the east, a religious feeling
generally pervades the people.</p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;Passed over to Brooklyn, a beautiful gay-looking
village of great extent in Long Island, in quest
of my old friend, and western fellow-traveller, Mr.
Wheeler, whom I found three miles from the city, living
on a hired farm of about 30 acres of arable land, and
six in wood, or rather cedar, on which is a beautiful house,
to which I was warmly welcomed. It consists of six
small rooms and piazzas on each side, standing in an
orchard fronting the public road, which, for four miles,
is like one continued suburban village all the way from
New York. The farm cost, two [410] years ago, without
a house or well, 3,500 dollars, and the house and well
have since cost 1,500 dollars. Mr. Wheeler has hired
this situation for one year only, at the rent of 300 dollars,
ten dollars an acre, all poor and long-exhausted land, insomuch
that nothing can be raised without manure, which
is bought at one dollar per load, and hauled three miles.</p>

<p>Land, thus situated, is expected to be devoted to raising
garden-stuff, or to be occupied only as a suburban retreat.
The mere farmer can scarcely live out of it, even if it is
his own, unless he cultivates vegetables, and carries his
milk to New York market, in small quantities, daily.
Those who have lived here eighteen or twenty years, on
their own estates, have only just lived, saved nothing, and
been always their own servants. Mr. Wheeler has three
servants, one black man, and a white man and woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
The white man has 100 dollars a-year; the black man ten
dollars a month; and the woman five dollars and board,
working from sun-rise to dark.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;After dinner, Mr. Wheeler ordered out of the
plough into the carriage, his pair of handsome greys,
when, with the ladies, we drove to the beautiful neighbouring
villages of New-town, Flushing, and Jamaica, at
the latter of which is the residence of Rufus King, Esq. a
house by no means equal to those of the village squires of
England, yet very inviting. Perhaps no where, [411] except
in the vicinity of London and Bath, can a more attractive
ride of twenty miles be found; the whole distance
of road, from the city, seeming one continued village of new
and handsome farm-houses, with either a pleasure-garden,
or green pasture, or orchard, or all of them, in front
of almost every house, any of which may be bought,
boards being up, <i>For sale, this farm</i>. But the land, in
every direction, is poor, except where superior and expensive
management exists. Every thing is sold from
the land, which might make manure and enrich it. The
leaves of the forest trees now begin to appear. The spring
is late, yet the orchards are in full bloom. The frost
was severe last night.</p>

<p>Though he has three servants, Mr. Wheeler cleans his
own boots. They would not absolutely refuse, but would
do it reluctantly, and feel disgraced by the act; yet two of
them are good servants. A black servant lately broke
into the cellar and dairy of Mr. Wheeler, and stole all the
bread and meat he could find; he is now in gaol. About
two years ago, in great rage with his sister, he caught hold
of her head, and endeavoured, with an axe, to chop it off;
but not being able to get it into a fit place, he chopped off
two of her fingers, and nailed them on the door-post!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;I made, on horseback, the tour of York island,
about ten miles in length and two in breadth. On one
side is the noble Hudson, or great North River, and on
the other, the East River [412] and Hell-gate, and the
beautiful villages of Manhattan, Haarlem, and Greenwich.
All the road from the city, to the extremity of,
and beyond the isle, is adorned, on both sides, with the
country-seats and pleasure-grounds of rich citizens, who,
like those of London, every morning and evening drive
to and fro in great numbers. Perhaps no city in the world
is so happily situated as that of New York, standing on
this island, with the sea to the south, and these majestic
rivers, from one to two miles wide, on the north and east,
the banks of which are very high, and for twelve miles
crowned with mansions. The houses on the roads, thus
leading through the isle to the city, have each from five
to ten acres of green pasture, park, or pleasure-gardens,
which renders them more rural, though less splendid than
those on the roads leading to London. I saw from fifty
to 100 convicts, heavily ironed, forming a new road for
the state; receiving no pay nor shirts, but only food.</p>

<p>I visited the supreme court, and inquired for Messrs.
Emmett and Sampson, but saw not these celebrated
refugees.<a name="FNanchor_150_47" id="FNanchor_150_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_47" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wheeler agreed to purchase a quantity of seed corn
from a neighbour, which was to be picked, but much of
it came in rotten. Mr. W. returned the rotten part, and
begged other corn to be sent in its place. "No, send it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
all back! that is not the way we deal here;" in great rage,
[413] said the farmer, "you may do so in your country,
but not here."</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Bade farewell to Long Island, and my much
esteemed friends, the Wheelers, who pressingly invited
me to stay longer. I renewed my invitation to them to
come and make Whitehall their home, when, if ever, they
came to England.</p>

<p>I quitted New York, for Philadelphia, at ten this morning.
Left a history of Somersham for Mr. F. Morse of
Newhaven.</p>

<p>Visited one of the packet-ships, the <i>James Monroe</i>, the
most complete I ever saw; every birth is a state room.
For forty guineas, it transports passengers to Liverpool
in high style. All are fed luxuriously.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;At six this morning, I left Borden town, on the
Delaware, where are the ruins of Joseph Bonaparte's
house, about to be rebuilt. Sixty men are employed
already. The estate, consisting of 300 acres, all poor
land, is now laying out into pleasure-grounds, and park,
enclosed with a fine fence; it cost five dollars an acre.
Joseph came hither, it is said, with ten millions of dollars
from the Spanish treasury.</p>

<p>I reached the City of Philadelphia at ten this morning,
just twenty-eight days after I left it, since which time I
have travelled about 2,000 miles, and rested eleven days.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 7th.</i>&mdash;I was present when Dr Storton, [414]
administered the rites of baptism to a large, respectable
auditory. He is rather pompous in his expressions, and
theatrical in his action and manner, but certainly an accomplished
man. He has said that there is no preaching
talent in America but what is imported; but this is not
strictly true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>11th.</i> I wrote the following epistle to Mr. Day, of St.
Ives in England, by the ship Electra, bound for London.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p class="ralign"><i>May 11, 1820.</i></p>

<p class="noidt">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>At this distance of time and place, the recollection of
you is replete with all that is good and pleasant to me;
while the esteem and regard always professed and felt
for you demand, at least, one epistle, as a thing not to be
withheld. I should have had great pleasure in your correspondence,
but it is now too late, as my duties here are
nearly at an end, and by the time this reaches you, I hope,
under the guidance of gracious Providence, that the compass,
in unison with my heart, will be pointing me towards
my own home and country.</p>

<p>The inducements to emigrate, and the facilities of living
here, are neither so great nor so many as I wished and
expected to find them. The majority of those who come
are without capital and above useful labour. Of this
kind seem our friends &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;, and others known
to you, whose [415] prospects are, I assure you, very shadowy.
I speak impartially. Even capital, I believe, can
any where be better employed than here. And as to
labourers, there are more than can be paid. By the late
report of this city, it appeared that 11,000 within these
walls were in a state of unemployed pauperism; while in
one prison only, are 600 thieves and incendiaries, the natural
fruits of increasing poverty.</p>

<p>Land, generally, is not property in this country, because
there is infinitely more than enough; the surplus,
therefore, is worth nothing. What is already in cultivation
by hired hands lessens, rather than augments capital.
Even potatoes, you know, cannot be produced from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
without the agency of the other. The markets are all
glutted, and without foreign demand, a surplus produce
is not desirable, because unsaleable and perishable.</p>

<p>All travel is restless labour, and "vanity and vexation
of spirit." Its idea was once so supremely fascinating to
my ambition, that I thought I never could have enough
of it, and therefore wished myself doomed to perpetual
travel. I have my wish, or something like it, and it disappoints
me. During the last two years I have indeed
found "no continuing city;" it is well if I seek and find
one to come. I fly from city to city, from town to town,
state to state, climate to climate, with the velocity of an
eagle. I have frigid and tropical latitudes, polar cold and
equinoxial heat, wintry desolation, [416] and the summery
foliage of oranges and myrtles, all in the short space of
one week, or less. For although this beautiful city of
William Penn lies in an Egyptian latitude, winter has not
long been over; whereas, it never enters the city of Charleston,
which I have just quitted, where</p>

"Blossoms and fruits and flowers together rise,<br />

</p>

<p>The male youth generally of this, and other cities, are
remarkably polished, sprightly and prepossessing in their
exterior; being of tall and slender figures, and looking free
and easy, without any thing like levity, for each puts on
all the airs, manners, actions, and opinions of men, with
his <i>first</i> pair of breeches, and expects to be treated as a
man. But ringlets decorate the faces of both sexes, and
in other respects all are dandies, male and female! The
young ladies generally are not so handsome as the males;
though beauty is not rare amongst them. A woman's
duties and province are, I think, yet undiscovered. She
is here, that is, in all sections south of the Delaware, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
little divinity, to whom all must bend, give place, and pay
idle homage; her tyranny is great, her influence unbounded.
Her lover, or husband, is outwardly her slave;
but as a wife, mother, mistress, she must yield to my unequalled
countrywomen. Youth here, is of very short
duration; all soon look old; and "all the days of the years
of this vain life," soon come to an end. Religion and
duty seem but little understood, [417] and less regarded,
except it be to ascertain how little of either may suffice.
Paley's Moral Philosophy has been, perhaps, the text
book of the educated, who are very numerous; yet but
few live and die practical philosophers. Death is little
dreaded, and often, as in duelling, voluntarily embraced.
Two selfish gods, Pleasure and Gain, enslave the Americans.
The scum of all the earth is drifted here.</p>

<p>As this is sent off about a month after my other, and will
be my last letter from this country, I wish you to inform
my good father, if living, and Mr. Ingle, of my present
refuge and intended return, and assure them of my best
regards. My beloved child, who, by-the-bye, would become
in part your ward if I returned no more, is very precious
in my sight; if you knew her, I should beg you to
pronounce a father's blessing on her; but it comes to her
on every western breeze. When I can, I will teach her
to esteem you, and perpetuate, what is of little value, the
disinterested and most sincere friendship of,</p>

</div>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Mistrust and suspicion are general in Philadelphia.
The cause is a general disregard or violation
of duty. Two respectable quakers would not suffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; to owe them eight [418] dollars for a day or two,
though guaranteed by a second person, who, for any thing
they knew, might be respectable; so they took out two
pieces of muslin to reduce the bill down to the funds
in hand. "Notwithstanding this guarantee," said the
quaker, "I will, and must have the thing squared." The
representative of my friend then paid the complete balance.
I was present at this transaction, and feeling both
pained and amused, began to speculate upon it, and to
consider what could have generated this general suspicion
and distrust. It is the common effect of some cause.
What cause? A general violation or neglect of some
prominent duties, not directly guarded by the laws, but
the observance of which is indispensable to the good of
mankind every where. Culpability of this kind, in not
doing to others as we would be done by, does more injury
to the world than all the thieves and incendiaries put
together; because the consequence in one case is particular,
in the other illimitable. If I act justly towards my
neighbour, I confer both temporal and moral good on him
and on myself. But it stops not here: he learns thereby
its value, and acts in like manner towards others. On
the other hand, if I violate my duty to him, he retaliates
not only on me, but on others indiscriminately. He
thinks he has been honest and unsuspicious long enough,
and bids adieu to rectitude perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>Last month at Dover, Delaware, Squire Loper [419]
received sentence of the court for passing forged notes,
knowing them to be so. He had been in the commission
of the peace for 20 years, and received the forged notes
from a gang convicted before him of forgery. The
notes had remained in his hands ever since. A month
ago, he desired a gentleman, a neighbour of his going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Philadelphia, to buy him some iron, and meeting the
gentleman privately, gave him fifty dollars, saying, "Take
notice it is a fifty dollar note," and gave it him carefully
wrapped in paper. When the bearer offered it for the iron,
it was discovered to be one of the forged notes, well known
to have been offered by the gang before. The gentleman
had some difficulty in keeping out of the Penitentiary.
On proving himself not to be a party concerned, and
promising to bring the Squire forward, he was released.
The Squire admitted the note to be forged, and said, he
gave it to his friend only in joke. On being arrested, he
was treated with great liberality, but he acted haughtily
and foolishly. On his trial he would not employ counsel
nor set up any defence; but in a cool, sneering manner
said, that the note was given in joke, and the court might
do as they would. He was sentenced to six months' solitary
confinement, thirty-nine lashes, and never after to
pass out of his own house in Dover without the letter F,
a foot long in scarlet, on his back, on pain of another six
months' confinement and thirty-nine stripes. But so great
was the [420] public pity for him, in court and out, both
with judge and jury, that the prison door was left open for
him in hope that he would escape and quit the neighbourhood
for ever. He did escape into the town only, and
came back to prison voluntarily, where no such chance
is again to be afforded him.</p>

<p>At night, I went to the black church, where the black
minister shewed much uncultivated talent. After sermon
they began singing merrily, and continued, without stopping,
one hour, till they became exhausted and breathless.
"Oh! come to Zion, come!" "Hallelujah, &amp;c." And then,
"O won't you have my lovely bleeding <i>Jasus</i>," a thousand
times repeated in full thundering chorus to the tune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of "Fol de rol." While all the time they were clapping
hands, shouting, and jumping, and exclaiming, "Ah
Lord! Good Lord! Give me <i>Jasus</i>! Amen." At half-past
ten this meeting broke up. For an hour it seemed
like Bedlam let loose. At the close, one female said,
striking the breasts of two male friends, "We had a happy
time of it."</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;Last week, in the state of Delaware, the High
Sheriff had to perform the duty of Jack Ketch, and hang
his own nephew, for the murder of his <i>own</i> mother, the
Sheriff's sister. The youth killed her by striking her
with a club on the temple. In the same neighbourhood
and the same week another youth was sent to gaol for
poisoning his uncle, a rich old gentleman, who being
childless, had [421] taken this nephew into the house and
made him heir to all; but the youth being impatient, went
to a druggist for arsenic, which he said was to kill the
rats, that every night kept his uncle from sleeping. He
mixed a portion of it in a glass of apple-toddy and gave it
to his uncle, but in so large a portion that it began to operate
immediately, on which the old man said, "You have
given me something to do me harm." The youth denied
it, but the old man grew rapidly sick, and feeling conscious
that he was poisoned and should die before the distant
doctor could arrive, got out the will in favor of the ungrateful
youth, and having burnt it, died soon after.</p>

<p>A short time ago, the friends of a murderer, under
sentence of death in Pennsylvania, conspired together to
procure a pardon from the governor, by threats and intimidation.
Their plan was to get the governor into a
room to themselves, and offer him his own life for the pardon
of Lieut. Smith, the convict, who had cohabited with
Mrs. Carson, and taken possession of her house and prop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>erty,
during the absence of her husband, Captain Carson.
When the latter returned and demanded his wife and
property, he was shot dead in his own house by Smith.
The governor had intelligence of the plot, and seized the
conspirators before they could carry their design into
effect.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 21st.</i>&mdash;Quitted Philadelphia on board the
steam-boat. A gentleman, Lieut. Skinner, of [422] the
United States' navy, from the Franklin, just arrived from
Gibraltar, states, that the sailors, on settling accounts, will
go on shore and spend the balance, several hundred dollars,
in two or three days, lavishing from 100 to 200 dollars
a-day, until all is gone, when they re-enter. So indifferent
are they to the use and value of money, that they give
it away, and suffer any person to plunder them with
impunity. The cause, says he, of this indifference and
insane extravagance, is to be found in the strictness and
severity of the discipline on board, where money is of no
use to them.</p>

<p><i>Duelling.</i>&mdash;So frequent were these meetings between
the officers of the United States' navy and the British
garrison, that the governor felt compelled to interfere, in
order to save life, as one or two duels occurred daily,
originating in the most foolish disputes.</p>

<p>The parties met always on neutral ground. For any
expression uttered by one officer of the 64th regiment, a
general challenge was sent by the officers of the United
States' navy to the regiment; wishing to include <i>all</i>, from
the colonel down to the lowest in rank.</p>

<p>Two young Americans, of New York, at Gibraltar, met
in consequence of a trifling dispute. The offending party
fired three times without hitting, while his opponent fired
every time into the air, begging the other to apologize,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
saying, "If I take aim I shall kill you, but I can stand all
your [423] fires." This concession was, however, obstinately
refused; on which the seconds stepped forward,
and said to the party who had acted so generously, "Sir,
you must fire in your own defence!" Both again charged,
and Sands, the aggressor, fell dead. The survivor was
arrested, but acquitted with honour; being told by his
commander, that if he had not acted thus, he would not
have received him again into the service. The young
reprobate who fell, was a classical scholar, of fine person
and great mental accomplishments, but ripe for perdition.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;I reached Washington city, now emptied of the
wise men, and which, after quitting Philadelphia, seems
mean, indeed, both morally and physically. All the bogs
and swamps, in and round the city, are now full of melody,
from the big, bellowing bull frog, down to the little
singing mosquito, while rotting carcases and other nuisances
perfume the warm southern breezes.</p>

<p>A lady, in a letter to Mr. Thomas Coote, from New
Orleans, states that eighteen American pirates under
sentence of death, in the jail of that city, have many
friends, much intent upon effecting a rescue, by forcing
the prison, which is strongly guarded by the military.
Every night almost, for this purpose, mobs collect around
it and set fire to distant parts of the city, in order to divert
the attention of the guards from the prison. Great alarm
exists on the subject, and it is feared, [424] that on the
day of execution, much blood will be spilt.</p>

<p>One hundred sail of slave-ships, full of slaves, appeared
in sight, one day, during this spring, off the coast of Africa.
Several of them were fast sailing vessels, built, owned, and
manned by the free citizens of free America. Some were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
chased and taken by the British and American navy.
This trade is now considered to be more extensive than
ever.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Visited Mr. Dunn, who states that the small red
squirrel, of this state, is seen to seize and castrate, in a
moment, the large grey squirrel, which greatly fears and
always flies at the sight of the former.</p>

<p>Are those English people who are now in America
happier than they were in England? I will take upon
me to pronounce, that in the aggregate, they are not.
Happiness and misery are not mere localities, for as God
is the father of all, the earth is his and the fulness thereof;
his frowns or smiles are not bounded by geographical lines
and latitudes; the whole human family are under his wise
economy. God's management is always right. He can
blast prosperity and bless disappointment, so as to keep
it from disappointing; thus bringing good out of evil, light
out of darkness, blessings out of curses, and curses out of
blessings. Blessings unblessed are curses in disguise, and
adversity blessed is a blessing. We need his blessing [425]
upon every thing, even on his blessings. I am sometimes
disposed to think that the blessings of American liberty
are unblessed.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott deems universal suffrage, as it exists in
America, an universal evil, because the worst and meanest
of mankind, who are the most numerous every where, are
enabled to exert an overwhelming influence over the good
and the honourable. Every man here is a segment of the
government. Mean and evil men seek to represent their
like. A good man cannot descend to the mean mode of
popularity; he cannot bribe with whiskey; he cannot
promise what is evil to perform; and therefore but few
good men are in the government. Antipathy to English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>men,
and whatever they suggest, is general and nearly
national.</p>

<p>For the following very interesting, original, and last
letter of a distinguished, yet unfortunate artist, I am
indebted to an old philosophical friend, whose well-judged
opinions of and extensive acquaintance with men and
things, make his sentiments precious and almost oracular.
Let him here receive my thanks for the many pleasant
hours which I spent in his company, and for the rich materials
of thinking gathered from him.</p>

<p class="noidt">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I embrace the opportunity of writing to you by the
favour of Mrs. Orris. I enclose a letter received [426]
from the celebrated <i>Francis Guy</i>, landscape painter, who
lately died at New York. He was at the head of his profession
in this country, and perhaps in the world. He
was born near Keswick, in Cumberland, England. I
knew him well, and esteemed him highly, as well for his
virtues as his talents. In this letter, (which I believe was
the last he wrote, it being dated only a few days before his
death) you will know the opinion of many artists, who
have left their country to seek for food and fame in this,
and see how they are rewarded for the exercise of their
talents in this great republic of North America. <i>He
(Guy) told me that he had not received 50 cents per day for
his labours!</i> You are welcome to any use of this letter.</p>

<p>Buildings seem to rise very fast, notwithstanding the
badness of the times, as they are termed.</p>

<p>Please to favour me with a letter as soon as convenient.
I am in daily expectation of the nuts, &amp;c. The ground
has been ploughed some weeks for their reception. I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

[427] <i>Brooklyn, Long Island</i>,<br />
<i>June 29th, 1820.</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">My Dear Friend,</p>

<p>I received yours, with its inclosures, in due time, and it
would be a difficult thing for me to describe the pleasure
I feel at seeing such a proof of your continued friendship.
There is, indeed, a something in a real upright and downright
honest John Bull, that cannot be found in the sly,
say-nothing, smiling, deep speculating, money-hunting
Jonathans of this all-men-are-born-equally-free-and-independent,
negro-driving, cow-skin republic.</p>

<p>It is surely wrong to be content with nothing, because
not blessed with all. We see bad effects, we hate them,
and we grumble, but ten to one it is because we are unacquainted
with the cause from whence they spring; but
there is one self-evident, hell-born cause of endless ills in
this land, which, for want of a better name, we will call
avarice. From Maine to Georgia, on all occasions, the
general question is, How much shall I get by it? What
will it fetch me? Pray what benefit will that be to me?
&amp;c. &amp;c. From this, man-stealing, mail robberies, piracy,
murders, thefts, swindling, forgeries, lying, cheating,
slavery, whips, gags, chains, and all the black catalogue
of monstrous ills proceed. Indeed, that angel who is
described by Milton as being more fond of admiring
Heaven's golden pavement, than any thing glorious aloft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
is the ruling god of this nation; and in imitation [428] of
him, they are for ever chasing dollars, walking half bent
under the accursed dominion of selfish views. But death,
the mighty hunter, will catch them all, and then, in company
with their god Belial, they will enjoy the name, title,
and privilege of <i>fools</i>. There is a national church liturgy
in England, and if ever there should be one adopted here,
the following I think ought to form a part of it.</p>

<p class="poem">
Money, money, is all our cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Money, the total sum!</span><br />
Give us money or else we die;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O let thy money come!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">But I am rambling from the Capitol. Your son has drawn
it very well, but I wish he had drawn it on a larger scale,
that the order of columns and windows might have been
more distinct. However, it is the wrong side of the building;
it is the east front and north end that I must paint,
looking down towards George-town, and the place I
sketched the view from was just above your house; therefore
I must paint the east front and north end. This,
like a fool, I forgot to inform you of; but if both fronts are
to be alike, then what you have sent will do; if not, then
I will thank both you and him to send me another drawing,
at least so far as the centre of the east front differs
from that of the west.</p>

<p>Since I wrote the above, Mr. King, the painter, has been
in this place, and informs us that both [429] fronts of the
capitol will be the same; therefore, if that be so, what you
have sent will answer; and when I come to your place in
the fall, I will reward your son for his drawing, or if he
choose to make a charge, I will send the money by the post,
whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Give my dutiful respects to Dr. Thornton, and tell him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that I wish he could see the picture of Washington city
when it is finished&mdash;I think it will be a grand sight. I
am now painting a large view of Chichester, in England,
for Governor Clinton; in which his likeness, with those of
Judge Miller and Doctor Mitchel, are to be painted on
the fore-ground. I wish the doctor could see this paradise
scenery also. You talk of coming to York; I wonder
if ever I shall have the pleasure of seeing you here. In
your last, you ask if I have any communications to send.
Perhaps I may have some to send concerning myself, for
be assured that if we do not now condescend to go out of
our old beaten track, we must fall through thick and thin.
When that should be, it would be no sin to do one of the
worst things in the world, that is, turn one's own trumpeter.</p>

all bad ones, and may you live contented, and die happy!</p>

<p>Thus you see I have written a letter, and on one [430]
account or another delayed sending it until there is need
to write another, to make an apology for the neglect.
Indeed, my good wife has been very unwell, and my concern
for her made me forget every thing else. This I know
you will say is a good and weighty excuse.</p>

<p><i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;News of firing the City of New Orleans,
in order to effect a rescue of the pirates, reached this city
this day. We hear, also, of the Choctaw Indians fighting,
150 opposed to 150, to avenge the death of an old woman,
killed for a witch. They fought until both sides, with the
exception of ten or twelve, were all killed.<a name="FNanchor_151_48" id="FNanchor_151_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_48" class="fnanchor">151<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></a></p>

<p>A man was taken and nearly killed, last week, disguised
as the devil, in the act of extorting 150 dollars from a
farmer. He was dressed, and spit fire and brimstone,
like a proper devil. He is now in prison. A Yankee
traveller, lodging for the night, struck this felonious devil
to the ground with a club, at the second visit to receive
dollars, instead of paper, as at first offered by the farmer
for the ransom of his body and soul.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;I met again Mr. Perry from Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
He states that the land and farms there are the
best in America; the average of wheat being about eighteen
bushels an acre. The best land is to be bought
occasionally at fifty dollars an acre, with improvements
which have cost all the money; so that the land is given.
[431] Here, he says, an English farmer may, as a farmer,
find much animal comfort, but no good society; the mass
of the farmers and people being vile, dishonest, and without
any good principles whatever. All try to rob and wrong
you, and each other, and will do it if you associate, or deal
in any way with them; and they will do it without any
shame, being shameless. An honest man, though rich,
must be soon ruined, if he puts confidence in them. "All
are tarred with the same brush." The farmers all work.
One, worth ten or twelve thousand dollars, brought in to
Mr. Perry a waggon load of hay, which he warranted was
a ton, though it was only sixteen cwt. Out of a farm of
good land, consisting of 500 acres, a farmer does not find
above 300 dollars a-year for the purchase of such necessaries
as the family need from the store. No money is,
therefore, to be made by farming, and the poor live in
want all winter, at which time their labour is to be had for
victuals only, and now for 25 cents a-day. From sober
calculation, he finds that four per cent. is the most that
can be obtained from capital employed in agriculture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
though six per cent, is the legal interest. He would, a
thousand times, rather give five or six guineas an acre
rent, for land at Feversham in Kent, than have it here
rent-free; for, after paying this heavy rent and taxes and
labour, he should have a good living profit in England,
where the climate is good, but here, one year [432] wears
you out more that seven in England. Grasshoppers too,
here, are a plague, destroying every thing, in the pestilential
months of August and September. There is no
money; all is done by barter.</p>

<p>He would recommend me and others to stick by England
while we can live in it, for he is sure, that if people in
England would attend to their duties, and condescend to
the meannesses and drudgeries every where practised here,
they must live, and live better at home than ever they can
here. And besides, though things are bad, there is a hope
of better times. Here, there is no hope; things will be
worse; for, with such an unprincipled, vile race of people,
how is it possible that liberty and happiness can be secure?
They know nothing of the nature of liberty, nor want to
know. Law, justice, equity, liberty, are things unknown
amongst them. In England, there is a good sound core,
and seed that must always vegetate; here, all is rottenness.
Mr. Perry believes, that grazing cattle in Pennsylvania,
would pay much better than cultivating.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;I re-visited Dr. Dawes's farm, which being in a
state of complete exhaustion, is unable to produce again
even the seed of any thing sown; the rye not affording what
is commonly scattered for gleaners in England, while the
peas, tares, and lentils rise not a foot high. This land can
only be restored to fruitfulness by rest, clover, plaster,
[433] and manure, and plenty of cattle and sheep to depasture
and manure it.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;This being a beautiful morning, the Doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
ordered out his curricle, and we drove to the seat and
plantation of the Right Honourable T. Law, accompanied
by Mr. Joel Simpson. I having been introduced to Mr.
Law, was appointed spokesman, and stood rapping at the
hall of entrance ten minutes before I was heard. At last
came a naked, dirty-legged, bare-footed little girl, to say
that Mr. Law was not at home, nor likely to be before
night. Soon after, came her father, the overseer, who
"regretted that Mr. Law was absent at an agricultural
dinner, as he was happy to see all callers." He, at my
request, shewed us the garden, the farm, and the stock.
The farm, about 250 acres, is beautifully situated on high
hills, two miles from the Potowmac, but so stony and unfruitful,
that its cultivation is a serious expense, rather
than a benefit, it being unable to maintain itself. The
garden and orchard, a few acres, seem equally poor;
small quantities of its produce are, however, sent from it
occasionally to market. At the bottom of it is a spa, or
mineral spring, in which the proprietor bathes. The
horses are all poor and fleshless, but the cattle and cows,
about twelve in number, fat. A cow and a bull of the
Yorkshire breed, from England, dislike (says the man)
this climate. [434] The cow gives but little milk, and
pines for the sweet, green pastures of her dear native land.</p>

<p>The English labourers, sent over to this farm, are all
gone, being drunken and worthless, and withal, so uncivil
and conceited, that Mr. Law, who likes men to talk
freely with him, could scarcely get a civil answer from any
of them. We were at last conducted into the house, and
introduced to a pint of whiskey. We saw no house-servants,
but heard one, a female slave recently bought,
the only slave Mr. Law owns. He lives in great simplicity.
The house is better than the best American farm-houses;
still, it is not a mansion, but rather something between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
both. In the centre and front, is a large oblong room, the
largest in the house, and resembling a hall of entrance, at
each end of which is a smaller room for the winter, and on
the other side, being a double house, are three small summer
rooms, and chambers over the whole. The road
through the farm up to the house is serpentine, and planted
with dying shrubs. It is rough, stony, and difficult of
ascent, and the entrance-gate (where might stand a porter's
lodge) is meaner than a hog-pen-gate. In this retreat
dined the President and 200 gentlemen last week. The
society admitted here is select, and the principal attraction
to it is Mr. Law, who is kind, agreeable, and benevolent
to all. In his personal appearance, he is small, lean, [435]
withered, and rustic. His nose, however, is noble, like
Lord Ellenborough's, but his mind is perhaps nobler than
that of any of the family, although he lives in greater simplicity
than a country squire of England.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;An old Scotsman, a perfect stranger, this morning
conscientiously brought back cloth to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s store,
to be re-measured, the same containing, he found, several
yards more than he had paid for, or expected to find. A
mistake had occurred in measuring. An American lady
of respectability, also of this city, was standing by, and,
in the greatest astonishment, exclaimed: "What! bring
it back because there is too much measure? Well, who
ever heard the like? I would not have done so, I'll warrant
ye." "O, my dear madam," said he, "I could not,
would not, have it without paying for it; it is not mine."
The proprietor of the store observed, very significantly,
looking her ladyship in the face, "Madam, I know of only
one rule, and that is, to do unto others as you would that
they should do unto you." She blushed, and said no
more. This shameless, unprincipled, selfishness is very
universal. It is customary, with this people, never to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
point out defects in goods, or errors in accounts, when
such defects and errors exist in their favour. The qualities,
honesty and dishonesty, as exemplified in these two
characters, seemed as if they were natural.</p>

<p>[436] <i>23rd.</i>&mdash;The mayor of this city, Samuel N. Smallwood,
Esq. now mayor for the second time, came here,
twenty years ago, a pennyless mechanic, but being industrious,
grew with the growth, and strengthened with the
strength, of this infant metropolis. His mother was a
yellow woman, and his origin is still distinguishable in
his curled hair, which he keeps close shorn. This, further
south, would have been a sin never to be forgiven. He is
a man of talent, and lives much respected.</p>

<p>This day I passed a pleasant farm on the eastern branch
of the Potowmac, half of it bottom land, and running a
mile and a half along the shore, with a good house and
offices, orchards, and large gardens. The hills are poor,
and covered with woods, amongst which cattle and pigs
graze, and breed, and fatten. It contains 667 acres, to
be bought at sixty dollars an acre, works twenty, and
might work thirty negroes, worth 9,000 dollars. It requires
an additional capital of 6,000 or 7,000 dollars, for
cultivating. Although much of this pleasant plantation
is in wood, yet it is said to produce annually,</p>

<p>Thus is a capital of 55,000 dollars employed, netting
twelve per cent., but the authority relied upon, in thus
stating the case, is not the best.</p>

<p>The Patriot pilot-boat, last war, sailed from New York
to Charleston city, for the Governor of South Carolina's
Lady, Mrs. Allstone, Mr. Burr's daughter,<a name="FNanchor_152_49" id="FNanchor_152_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_49" class="fnanchor">152</a> then at
Charleston, who, with Mr. Green, her brother-in-law,
and servant, plate and specie, sailed from Charleston.
They were heard of no more, until last month, when one
of the pirates, under sentence of death at New Orleans,
confessed that he and others, of the crew of the Patriot,
rose upon the captain and the passengers, confined them
below, scuttled the vessel, and abandoned her, taking to
the boat, in which, with all the money and plate they could
find, they [438] landed on the coast of North Carolina,
while the vessel, and all it contained, sunk to rise no more.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;I re-visited the seat of Mr. Law, in company with
Mr. Elliott, and the Rev. J. Wright. Mr. Law was dining
out, three miles from home. I saw him not, but kept
possession of the house three hours.</p>

<p>Mr. Law told a friend of mine that he brought 100,000
guineas in gold, but could not now raise, by any means, at
a short notice, 1,000<i>l.</i> City lots and land allured him almost
to ruin. Land seems a substance, but is yet only a
shadow in many neighbourhoods.</p>

<p><i>A common hot day at Washington.</i>&mdash;The wind southerly,
like the breath of an oven; the thermometer vacillating
between 90 and 100; the sky blue and cloudless; the sun
shedding a blazing light; the face of the land, and every
thing upon it, save trees, withered, dusty, baked, and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>tinually
heated, insomuch that water would almost hiss
on it; the atmosphere swarming with noxious insects, flies,
bugs, mosquitoes, and grasshoppers, and withal so drying,
that all animal and vegetable life is exposed to a continual
process of exhaustion. The breezes, if any, are
perfumed by nuisances of all sorts, emptied into the streets,
rotting carcases, and the exhalations of dismal swamps,
made vocal and alive with toads, lizards, and bellowing
bull-frogs. Few people are stirring, except negroes; all
faces, save those [439] of blacks, pale, languid, and lengthened
with lassitude, expressive of any thing but ease and
happiness. Now and then an emigrant or two fall dead
at the cold spring, or fountain; others are lying on the
floor, flat on their backs; all, whether idle or employed,
are comfortless, being in an everlasting steam-bath, and
feeling offensive to themselves and others. At table,
pleased with nothing, because both vegetable and animal
food is generally withered, toughened, and tainted; the
beverage, tea or coffee, contains dead flies; the beds and
bed-rooms, at night, present a smothering unaltering
warmth, the walls being thoroughly heated, and being
withinside like the outside of an oven in continual use.
Hard is the lot of him who bears the heat and burthen of
this day, and pitiable the fate of the poor emigrant sighing
in vain for comforts, cool breezes, wholesome diet, and
the old friends of his native land. At midnight, the
lightning-bugs and bull-frogs become luminous and melodious.
The flies seem an Egyptian plague, and get mortised
into the oily butter, which holds them like birdlime.</p>

<p>Having requested some communication on the subject
of farming, and other matters, in Pennsylvania, from a
friend, possessing great experience, I was favoured with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the following heads, which contain much information in
a condensed form.</p>

<p>[440] <i>1st. Pennsylvania.</i>&mdash;The land is of the first quality,
and the best farming in the United States is found here.
The climate is of a medium temperature, but the extremes
meet as in the other states.</p>

<p><i>2nd. Crops.</i>&mdash;The average produce is sixteen bushels,
per acre, of wheat; other grain in proportion; but the crops
are very subject to the Hessian fly and mildew.</p>

<p><i>3rd. Fruit.</i>&mdash;As in the other states, it is inferior to that
of Europe, and no dependence is to be placed on crops.</p>

<p><i>4th. Garden.</i>&mdash;One acre of land in England, produces
more vegetables than five acres in the United States, taking
the year throughout. N.B. This matter has been most
grossly misrepresented.</p>

<p><i>5th. Grazing Land.</i>&mdash;During five months in the year,
there is no pasture for cattle.</p>

<p><i>6th. Price of Land.</i>&mdash;Varies from 50 to 100 dollars
with improvements, that is, with a good house and
barn.</p>

<p><i>7th. Timber.</i>&mdash;Sufficient exists at present; but should
the population increase rapidly, it will become a scarce
article.</p>

<p><i>8th. Game.</i>&mdash;Scarce; which is generally the case through
the States. No country in the world is worse supplied
with game, and in a few years the game will be entirely
annihilated, owing to the extreme inclemency of the winters,
and there being no cover for them in the woods.</p>

<p>[441] <i>9th. Fish.</i>&mdash;Taking the States through, the supply
of this article is trifling.</p>

<p><i>10th. Farmers.</i>&mdash;The generality of this class are Germans
of the lowest grade; industrious, but nothing further,
and forming no society for an English yeoman. The rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of the population is composed of descendants of the old
settlers and of low people of Irish origin.</p>

<p><i>11th. Residence.</i>&mdash;An emigrant requires at the least
twelve months. N.B. The United States teem with
jobbing lawyers, land speculators, and swindlers.</p>

<p><i>12th. Grazing and stall-feeding cattle for market.</i>&mdash;This
line might be followed to advantage with a capital of
4,000 dollars, and with what is of more consequence, the
knowledge of dealing or trafficking, for without such
knowledge the noble would soon be reduced to nine-pence.
A twelve months' residence is, therefore, indispensably
necessary, for without being fully initiated in the diabolical
arts of <i>lying out</i>, <i>swearing out</i>, <i>swindling out</i>, and <i>thieving
out</i>, ruin is inevitable.</p>

<p><i>13th. Society.</i>&mdash;There is none for an Englishman of the
old school, who would scorn to tell a lie, or see his fellow
man in want.</p>

<p><i>14th. Happiness.</i>&mdash;Must be found in your own family;
the fruits of your farm will supply every want, and whilst
the government of the United States continues as at present,
you will be secured in that happiness.</p>

<p>[442] <i>15th.</i>&mdash;One matter I had almost forgot, which I
must not omit to mention, as you most likely will be asked
questions on the subject by many of that most useful and
invaluable class, English husbandmen.</p>

<p><i>1st. Wages.</i>&mdash;The highest wages given at this time for
<i>harvest</i> are, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per day, English money, and found in
provision and bad whiskey.</p>

<p><i>2nd. Working hours.</i>&mdash;From sunrise to sunset, full sixteen
hours.</p>

<p><i>3d. How long does the harvest last?</i>&mdash;About three weeks.</p>

<p><i>4th. Is it warm in harvest time?</i>&mdash;Excessively so. The
thermometer ranges from 86 to 120. It is impossible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
have a just idea of it without actual experience. And,
what is of more consequence, an English husbandman
would be more <i>debilitated</i> in <i>three years</i> in the United
States, than in <i>sixteen years</i> in England.</p>

<p><i>5th. How long in the year can labour be procured?</i>&mdash;About
six months.</p>

<p><i>6th. Are wages paid regularly?</i>&mdash;Very rarely. Mostly
defrauded.</p>

<p><i>7th. Then who are the persons that can do?</i>&mdash;A man
with a family of hard-working children, possessing 300<i>l.</i>
sterling, and who should reside twelve months in the
States before he purchases land. And it is greatly to be
feared that both the emigrant and his family must lay in
all the low cunning, and [l]earn to defraud and cheat, as
practised [443] here, and entirely forget old English principles
and society, or else ruin and misery will be his portion.</p>

<p><i>8th. Mechanics.</i>&mdash;Any part of the world before the
United States, for, whatever they may earn, they will be
sure to be defrauded out of half.</p>

<p><i>9th. Wages.</i>&mdash;Not so much as in England, taking the
year through.</p>

<p><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;Visited the house of the President, a good,
substantial, pleasant abode, but neither so elegant, superb,
nor costly as the seats of our nobility. I saw nothing about
it remarkable; no pictures, save Washington's; no curiosities,
no painted ceilings. The walls are covered with
French paper, and the rooms are furnished with French
furniture. Its front looks over the Potowmac and Alexandria,
down to Mount Vernon, through a vast extent of
Southern Virginian scenery. A favourite English butler
shewed us all, and regaled us with good biscuit, brandy,
and sherry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;This morning the Hon. Thomas Law, accompanied
by Mr. Elliott, made me a call in return for mine.
He very politely regretted his absence when I called, and
invited me to come and spend a day or two with him at
his farm, for the purpose of concluding the conversation
now commenced in the following words.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Law.</i>&mdash;"You, Mr. F., saw my farm and garden.
They are poor, but I will improve the gravelly hills by
carting earth on to them from the [444] valleys. The
English labourers sent to me by Mr. Curwen, I have dismissed.
They could do nothing but plough; they were
stupid, conceited, uncivil, and latterly drunken; whiskey,
and the company they met, seduced them. When I began
farming I knew not wheat from rye, or rye from barley;
but I well know what are the benefits of farming." "You,
Sir, pursue it only for your pleasure?" "No, Sir, I want
profit." "In the present distressed state of agriculture
little profit is to be had." "Truly so; but a paper circulation
is wanted. Mr. Crawford fully agreed with me
on this point, but disingenuously seceded from it in his
report, on which account I have addressed several pointed
letters to him, which I will send you as well as my address
to the agricultural society of Prince George's county."</p>

<p>"On my return home shall I advise and recommend
my countrymen to emigrate here?" "Why, Sir, I cannot
answer that question. I have never recommended
emigration, nor caused any to quit their country; every
thing is strange and unsuitable to English farmers and
labourers; he can cultivate with success only by slaves."
"Have you, Mr. Law, no regrets at having spent so much
of your time in this country?" "No, Sir, none whatever."
"What, Sir, none at the loss of that society which you
must have had in common with your family in England?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Here Mr. Law hesitated a little as if at a loss for an
answer. "Why, [445] Sir, I once with Lord Cornwallis
governed India. I returned and saw my acquaintance
sliding into commerce, brewers, manufacturers, and merchants,
to be cheated; such a course had no attractions for
me, and I was opposed to the French war and other government
measures. I therefore determined on visiting and
ultimately on living in this country, where I have spent
my time much to my satisfaction, never being at a loss for
amusement. I write and read, and talk and visit, on the
most familiar and friendly terms with my neighbours, with
whom I frequently stay all night; and whenever I please,
I can without ceremony go and talk frequently and freely
with the President, Mr. Crawford, Calhoun, and all the
heads of the government, and therefore I have the best
society the land affords." "But, Sir, there are the honours
and emoluments of England which <i>must</i> have been yours."
"My wants were then, and have always been, very few.
I believe I have always been happier than any of my
brothers. As I never knew how to say 'My lord' to any
man, I did not seek or want honours or emoluments. I
saw my family and friends dependant on the funds which
are likely some day to beggar them and many others; a
situation from which I fled." "What, Mr. Law, is likely
to remedy the diseases of England?" "Sir! England is
over-peopled. It is not wholly the fault of the government.
A famine will be the remedy." "Could not the
surplus population [446] be transported to the colonies?"
"No, Sir. A famine is the only remedy." "But, Sir, is
not a famine calculated to plunge the country into a
dreadful political convulsion and revolution?" "It is,
Sir, but the government is not blameable."</p>

<p>"Morally considered, or with respect to morals, do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
you not think the population of this country inferior to
that of England?" "The people in the mass are here
more intelligent. You now see them at the worst
time. You see them <i>generally</i> acting unworthily and
meanly, but their poverty and not their will consents.
As to slaves, they steal." "And they have a right to
steal," said a third person. I answered, "They, to be
sure, have been robbed on a broad scale." "Why,
Sir, the friends of slavery insist on it that slavery is essential
to the existence of liberty. To what conclusions will
they not come?"</p>

<p>"Is there, Mr. Law, no aristocratical feeling in this
country?" "Yes, Sir, amongst the black population."
"You mean, Sir, amongst the masters of blacks?"
"Yes, Sir. You, Sir, have visited Mr. Birkbeck?" "I
have." "Is he not a very pleasant, intelligent man?"
"He is highly so." "What is he doing?" "Fast spending
dollars." "Had he raised any produce?" "None."
"Why?" "He had been, he said, occupied in settling
his neighbours, who together with himself have been
supplied with provisions from Harmony at 100 per cent,
above their value; but cheaper, they have [447] said, than
they could have then and there raised them." "I, Sir,
do not approve of going into the wilderness away from
market and society, while land is to be had with both.
What is Harmony?" "It is a most flourishing settlement,
and indeed the only flourishing one I saw in the
wilderness. What think you, Mr. Law, of the climate?"
"Why, Sir, as Lloyd says,</p>

<p class="poem">
"With things at once so hot and cold,<br />
I can no friendship hold."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Mr. Law talks in an oratorical manner, and with an
energy of action which makes him appear much in earnest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
He is full to overflowing, and quite inexhaustible. "His
worth," says Mr. Elliott, "is not one-tenth of it known,
but is thrown away upon this country."</p>

<p>"It is said, Sir, that the population of this country is
systematically unprincipled, and almost without virtue."
"That, Sir, is not true. In the cities, since the commercial
distress, the people seem dishonest. The commercial
demand from England, and the withdrawing a paper
capital by this government, have driven the people to
desperation. They are unjustly done by. They were
once esteemed good customers. A circulating medium
only is wanted to heal the breach. In the country the
people are anxious to meet their engagements." "Do
you, Sir, think that no remedy but famine remains for
England?" "No, Sir! no other." "Then the sooner
it comes the better." "But, Sir, (said he) [448] such
confusion, and horror, and calamity, will characterize the
catastrophe as the world has not seen." "Do you think
it will exceed the French revolution? Will the people of
England be more bloody and heartless in such a struggle
than the French?" "The desperation of their situation
will make them so. Consider, Sir, the rage, anguish, and
collision of so many starving millions, screwed up into a
space not larger than our state of Virginia. Here, Sir,
we have plenty, and whether sleeping or waking are safe
in our houses, and liberty and prosperity are secure.
You, I find, are deputed to collect information. Dine
with me on Monday, and I will get my sons out to meet
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Law finding that I wished a protection or special
passport from the British minister, Mr. Antrobus, went
and applied for it, but did not succeed, it should seem,
because I was acquainted with &mdash;&mdash; on the black books of
the government. "Mr. C.," said Mr. Law, "is a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
intelligent man, but I find he carried things with a high,
offensive hand in England. He, I believe, Sir, wrote the
Watchman and alarmed the church and the Bishop of
Ely."</p>

<p>Mr. Law seems not to like the radicals. "When," says
he, "I came to this country from India, it seemed at first
like going down to the grave. I seemed buried. Tell my
family that I drink daily rye-coffee and whiskey."</p>

<p>[449] Recipe for making rye-coffee, equal to the West
Indian, after Mr. Law's fashion. Swell the rye in warm
water before you roast it.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;I received the following letter from Mr. Law.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p class="ralign"><i>Saturday, 8th July, 1820.</i></p>

<p class="noidt">Sir,</p>

<p>I wish you, if you see Mr. Elliott of the Patent-office,
to desire him to come and dine on Monday. If you can
visit me early, I will shew you the neighbourhood, and in
conversation you may obtain whatever opinions I have
formed from experience respecting this country. It is
most desirable that correct information should be given
to those who are necessitated to seek an asylum here.</p>

<p>An European ought not to travel far into the interior,
as he must sacrifice every comfort during life. Want of
society, want of hands, want of a market, want of medical
aid; in short, almost every want is experienced for many
years; discontent soon destroys the harmony of associates,
and former attachments to those left behind have double
power to excite regrets.</p>

<p>The Americans are a migrating race, and quit their
farms to seek rich back lands; but more of this when I
have the pleasure to see you.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Yours most obediently,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">T. Law</span>.<br />
</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, 9th.</i>&mdash;By appointment, I breakfasted with
Major Young, 45 years from Ireland, and [450] from the
first an enthusiast in the cause of America, throughout the
revolution up to this time, having been the companion in
arms of General Washington, and appointed to the honour
of delivering Lord Cornwallis his discharge from his
parole of honour. His lordship graciously received it
from the Major at his house in London, much pleased
that he was not compelled to return to America to discharge
his parole, having been exchanged for Mr. Laurens
in the Tower. "Major," said his lordship, "I feel obliged
to you and others, and will hold myself under obligation
to serve you at any time." The Major gave him an opportunity,
and was served. Mr. Laurens, while in the tower,
was consulted by a friend of Lord Hillsborough, the minister,
on this question: "What, Mr. Laurens, would you,
as a friend to America, advise England to do at the present
juncture." "Why, Sir, the experience of ages proves
that an ounce of honey is worth a ton of vinegar." His
lordship on hearing this, in great rage rejoined, "America
has had too much honey; she shall have more vinegar."</p>

<p>Mr. John Law, during the attack on Washington,
served in the United States' army as a sergeant; but after
the British got possession, he laid aside his uniform, and
telling the British officers that he was the nephew of Lord
Ellenborough, invited them to his house, where they spent
a joyful evening together.</p>

<p>[451] <i>10th.</i>&mdash;By Mr. Elliott, I was introduced to Major
Roberts, at the public department of engineers.<a name="FNanchor_153_50" id="FNanchor_153_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_50" class="fnanchor">153</a> I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
accompanied by Mr. John and Mr. Edmund Law, two
natives of Asia, to the seat of their father to dinner, where
we met Mr. Carter, Mr. Elliott, Colonel Heb, and his
friend, a Cantab. Our dinner consisted of lamb, ham
and chicken, and blackberry pie, with claret, brandy, and
whiskey, the latter 15 years old. Here was all ease and
no ceremony. Every guest seemed as free as if at home,
and eat, drank, and talked as he pleased. As this dinner
was on my account, Mr. Law placed me on his right hand
as his guest. The two Asiatic sons of Mr. Law seem
generous, kind-hearted, and most intelligent young gentlemen,
free from all aristocratic pride.</p>

<p>Mr. John Law, during our ride to dinner, observed that
his father's objection to slavery was rooted in mere prejudice,
because, though he might buy slaves, he could emancipate
them when he pleased. I told Mr. Law, their
father, what they said of this prejudice. "Aye," said
he, "call it what they please, I am acting from a good and
proper motive. Wherever there are blacks, the white
population is seen to decrease. The blacks will free
themselves in the south; their resistance and insurrection
will be horrid and irresistible; the free states will never
stir an inch to oppose the blacks or to assist the planters,
who have no feelings in common with the farmers and
[452] people of free states. The former oppose domestic
manufactures, because they think England can give them
more for produce than their countrymen, and therefore
they are willing that their countrymen should be drained
of money for the support of British manufactures."</p>

<p>Free blacks, in all the above states, are an especial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
nuisance, because they are deemed the cause of insurrection
amongst slaves, and act as brokers to them, or receivers
of whatever the slaves steal.</p>

<p>Birkbeck and Flower became the theme of the evening.
Mr. Law, and all present, regretted that they did not
settle in this, or some populous neighbourhood, where
they might have lived as the most distinguished citizens,
and at a much less cost than now. They might have
visited and been visited by the President, and all the
heads of departments; had a town and country house,
plenty of land, increasing in value, and good markets;
plenty of comforts of all kinds; farms, houses, orchards,
gardens, and every convenience formed to their hands,
at less than the cost of improvements, so that the land is a
gift into the bargain. What madness to go into the wilderness!
Their land is not advanced in value by their mere
residence on it. They might have invested money, on
land, in the best western neighbourhoods, and, without
sacrificing themselves, their posterity would have reaped
the benefit, which must be slow, but which is sure to come
with population and population only. [453] They thought
that land must increase in value in the west, forgetting that
there was an infinite supply at the same price; and, besides,
how could they be sure that settlers would follow
and give an advance. It was madness so to spend this
short life. They ought to have known that working
Yankee families, who do all the labour themselves, are
the only proper pioneers. Gentlemen-farmers should not
remove into the west, until they can live and do better
there than here. At any rate it is time enough to go when
they can be the third or fourth buyers of farms; when they
can have the improvements at less than the cost, and the
land nearly into the bargain. Society and visiting, so indis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>pensable
to such intelligent Englishmen, they might here
have cheaply. "I entertained (continued Mr. Law) the
President and heads of departments, and 100 friends besides,
to dinner, at this house, on such a dinner, as we have
had to-day, and a little light wine, and the cost of all was
only 40 dollars. My good neighbours, it is true, sent me
hams and rounds of beef, ready cooked, because they
thought I should find it difficult to cook for so many. If I
were in England, I must have my Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and others of
the same rank; all must be splendid, costly, and pompous;
but all this is not the hospitality which I like and find
here. Here we go and come, as, and when we please;
no previous notice is necessary; [454] we give and take
freely of such things as we have, and no one is inconvenienced.
In England a house is alarmed by the arrival of
an unexpected visitor. As neighbours and visitors we
are all equal, and share good things in common."</p>

<p>We walked through the large garden, where Mr. Law
boasted that he should have 2,000 celery plants for market
at 12&frac12; cents each. All farmers send their garden produce
three times a week to market. "What I send (says Mr.
Law) pays the expense of the gardener, and puts 100 dollars
into my pocket, exclusive of my butter, which furnishes
me with butcher's meat, &amp;c. My farm, at present,
does not, but it will, more than support my establishment."</p>

<p>He has two women, one white, one black, two or three
negro children, and five or six labourers hired at from
eight dollars to twelve dollars per month, most of whom
are to leave in winter.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the company departed, except myself.
Mr. Law pressed me to stay and spend a day or two longer,
so that we might visit Colonel Heb next day, and see the
neighbourhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>We were seated together alone, on the lawn, in the cool
of the evening, until ten o'clock, when Mr. Law, with a
light in his hand, kindly conducted me to my bed-room.
During these two hours we talked freely; first, on the
state of England, which, he says, must fall in a few years.
"With [455] such a debt, and so many drones, and having
all the world rivalling and excluding British manufactures,
and with such a superabundant population, it is
impossible that she can long exist in her present condition.
A famine must certainly sweep away superfluous
millions. It will be brought about, first, by a scarce year,
and secondly, by the want of specie to pay for foreign
grain; for specie only will do, when manufactures shall
not be wanted in exchange for grain. Then the British
people, instead of lying down and dying willingly like the
Hindoos, a scene which I witnessed, will rise with an irresistible
fury, sweeping all authorities before them." "After
such a storm, will they dispense with monarchy, &amp;c.?"
"No, Sir, I think not. King, lords, and commons, seem
acceptable to the people. The church and the debt only
will be annihilated. My friends and others in the funds
see that this catastrophe is coming. They are therefore
unhappy. I see they are eaten up by anxiety; I am happier
than any of them. Many of the rich, and several of
my friends and family, live on the European continent,
to spend their money in ease and peace. They are all
unhappy in their prospects. It is true that I have been
unsuccessful in my speculations here, but my wants are
few. I was advised by General Washington to invest my
money in and about this city, which every one then deemed
a good speculation, and it would have been so but for the
stupidity and blundering [456] ignorance of this government,
which by diminishing the currency, has reduced our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
estates 50 or 60 per cent. and rendered all unsaleable.
There is no money for use. It is impossible that a people
can flourish without a circulating medium; a floating capital,
which creates a fixed capital. This government, however,
will see the need of it and resort to it; for, if the capital
once in circulation had remained so, the public lands
would have doubled their present value, and the industrious
have flourished instead of sinking into ruin. The poor
and industrious are the only proper objects of the care and
protection of government." "You knew Paley. What
think you of his philosophy, &amp;c.?" "I knew him well;
he was a good man, but his philosophy is false. Utility
is made its basis; but impulse and feeling furnish the best
moral guide. Every feeling in man points him to goodness."
"But, Sir," said I, "is not his philosophy in accordance
with Christianity?" "Perhaps it is." I rejoined
that I could not help revering it, and that after reading
it I thought myself both wiser and better. "That may
be." "You knew and esteemed Sir Wm. Jones in India.
Was he not a Christian?" "Why sir, Lord Teignmouth
has endeavoured to make him appear so; but he was a
free thinker, and unusually vain. Instead of studying
his duties and introducing good laws, he was ambitious
of learning all languages, and of being a finished antiquarian
and poet. He fell a victim to his intense [457]
application. He would never travel, except by night;
the sun must not see him. He once travelled through
my district by night, and I accompanied him. At sunset
he would inquire: 'Is my enemy down?' If answered,
'Yes,' he would then start."</p>

<p>"Did you see M. Volney,<a name="FNanchor_154_51" id="FNanchor_154_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_51" class="fnanchor">154</a> during his tour in this coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>try?"
"I did; he came, introduced to me by General
Washington, and spent some days with me; he spoke our
language well, and was a very wise man."</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Mr. Law and myself rose about sunrise. I
walked, while he was engaged in writing some materials
or arguments for my journal. He writes with great velocity.</p>

<p>After breakfast we rode to the pleasant farm of Colonel
Heb to dine, where, with his lady and family, we met a
young Cantab, and his lady, who sweetly sung and played
for Mr. Law on the piano, with which he seemed enraptured.</p>

<p>We then viewed the Colonel's estate, consisting of 600
acres, of hill and dale, 90 of which are meadow irrigated,
and which produces 2,000 dollars in hay annually, while
the tobacco<a name="FNanchor_155_52" id="FNanchor_155_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_52" class="fnanchor">155</a> crop is [458] commonly worth from 100
to 150 dollars an acre. Here is a marl bank, by which the
Colonel has improved the estate, which, including its first
cost, employs 20,000 dollars, and nets, from 12 to 15 per
cent. It is cultivated by from 12 to 20 negroes, who seem
happy and well treated, singing and working merrily.
The Colonel thinks slaves are better off than free-men.
All slave-holders think so, especially those idle men who
keep them merely for hiring out, that they may live entirely
by the labour and breeding of blacks. Free blacks,
in a slave state, are most of them unhappy.</p>

<p>Mr. Law thinks that Colonel Heb saves little or nothing
from this estate, after deducting the expenses of hospitality,
education, and other out-goings. Part of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
dessert, at dinner, was strawberries, which, during the
summer, bear fruit continually, each month yielding a
fresh supply. We quitted this hospitable abode at seven,
p. m., and, on reaching home, resumed our conversation
till bedtime.</p>

<p>Mr. Law said, that when last in England, he visited his
brother, the now Bishop of Chester, then living on a small
benefice, at Kelshall, near Royston, where all the neighbourhood
seemed dissenters. "My brother did all he
could to please them, but they would not come to church.
My brother did not like it, and feared that his congregation
would be reduced to the clerk and his own family.
Indeed it seldom was more. [459] What a nest," said Mr.
Law, "is the church for hypocrites. All churches are
evils, especially when they condemn a difference of opinion,
and compel the dissenters therefrom to support the
church. Religion is matter of opinion; all have a right
to think freely thereon. I wonder how my brother got
preferment, when I know he was refractory, and could
not submit to the pride and domination of Lord Ellenborough."</p>

<p>"The convulsion in England," says Mr. Law, "will
not last long, but it will be horrid; it will sweep away the
drones. I saw my friends spending their days ingloriously,
and descending to the grave, sick of themselves,
and without doing any good to the world.</p>

<p>"My good brother, the Irish Bishop, the most learned
of our family, came from Ireland, purposely to see me.
He is now dead. There is no independence about
bishops. They only seek preferment."</p>

<p>Mr. Law repeated to me some satirical lines which he
wrote against the * * * &nbsp; * * * "These lines
his lordship feared should be shown. He made peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with me and gave up to me. His lordship said, 'I must
give up to Tom, or he will expose me to my brother
lawyers, and I shall become their butt.'" These lines
represented the * * * &nbsp; * * * as the perfection
of pride, and seeking to be Chancellor, being already
one in insolence.</p>

<p>[460] "You have not, I suppose, at any time, directly
or indirectly, formed a part of this government?" "No,
Sir, I would see them at the d&mdash;l first." "Is Mr. President
Monroe a man of business?" "Yes, Sir. The Presidents
are all slaves to their duties, scarcely able to breathe
abroad or take air." On passing by the Capitol, I said,
"Does this sumptuous Capitol accord with the plainness
of republicanism?" "No, Sir, but laying stones one upon
another rarely injures any nation; and besides, republics
are vain, and public buildings gratify their vanity, and
attach them to the country. Inasmuch (said Mr. Law)
as this government has left unprotected the manufacturers
of the country, and withdrawn the circulating medium
from the people generally, it has done all which an enemy
to this or any country could do, or wish to see done." I
asked Mr. Law if it was worth while to visit Mount
Vernon. He said, "Mount Vernon is inviting, but Judge
W. knows nothing."</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;In our ride to the city this morning, with a negro
behind us, two gentlemen, Mr. Law's neighbours, overtook
us, but being anxious to get on before us, apologized
for leaving us. "Oh! gentlemen!" said Mr. L., "we do
not want you to wait for us. Go, I pray you, to the devil
if you will!"</p>

<p>At parting with Mr. Law this morning, he promised to
send me letters of introduction to his [461] Right Rev.
Brother, the Bishop of Chester, and his distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cousin, J. C. Curwen, Esq. M. P. which letters, together
with the following curious observations, purposely written
by him for the use of this journal, were soon after transmitted
to me.</p>

<p><i>Observations by Mr. Law.</i>&mdash;"I have lately perused an
address to the public from the delegation of the United
Agricultural Society of Virginia. If, after repeated
perusals, I had been convinced that the exclusion of
such foreign manufactures as we can make ourselves, by
legislative measures, such as high duties or prohibitions,
would be injurious to agriculturists, I should immediately
acknowledge my acquiescence in their reasoning. To
oppose the opinions and arguments of such able men, and
of such united members, exposes any one to the imputation
of vanity, and to inevitable ridicule, should his reasoning
prove inconclusive. I have always been an advocate
for permitting men to pursue their interests unobstructed
by governmental interference, according to the
suggestions of their reason, and to seek future salvation
according to the dictates of their conscience; and I have
always been convinced that men will employ their capitals
and industry in that business which produces most profit.
This is, indeed, an incontrovertible axiom in political
economy; and the only question to determine, is whether
the exclusion of foreign manufactures be [462] not a
salutary exception to the rule. The delegation above mentioned,
accuses the petitioning manufacturers of soliciting
a monopoly. A monopoly, according to my definition
of the term, means an exclusive privilege in favour
of an individual, or a certain class of men, in preference
to all others, who are injured thereby. Now to me it
appears that the duties or prohibitions solicited, are solely
for the encouragement of domestic manufactures, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the discouragement of foreign ones; nay, in my opinion,
it seems a request in the name of all Americans, to be
shielded from foreign monopoly. This observation will
at first surprise you, but after my explanation it will, I
trust, have more verisimilitude in it than you can now
imagine. Suppose a sovereign to say that in a certain
county, or department, he would make a donation of
capital for building machinery, &amp;c. to those who would
establish a certain manufacture. Should any other of
his subjects attempt rivalship, with his, or their own funds,
could not those, who had their capitals gratis, undersell
the competitor or competitors? Say that the buildings
and machinery cost 100,000 dollars, and that 50,000 dollars,
current capital, were required to pay workmen, and
buy materials. The former aided by the sovereign, if
they made ten per cent. on their current capital, would
receive 5,000 dollars per annum, but the latter, if he
obtained only a [463] profit of 5,000 dollars on his 150,000
dollars laid out, would only receive three and a third
per cent. Now the foreign manufacturer has a capital
from his father, which is useless to him, if not employed.
Say his buildings, machinery, and 50,000 dollars current
capital, produce him 15,000 dollars. If he finds foreigners,
who heretofore purchased from him, attempting to set
up for themselves, will it not be good policy in him to
reduce his profits two thirds, to ruin his incipient rivals?
Mr. Brougham, in the House of Commons, used the following
language, when speaking of the loss to merchants
by an excessive exportation of manufactures:&mdash;<i>it was
worth while to incur a loss, in order, by the glut, to stifle
in the cradle those rising manufactures in the United States,
which the war had forced into existence, contrary to the
natural course of things</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it not have been humane and judicious in
Congress, to have prevented this ruinous glut, which contributed,
with the order to resume specie payments, to
crush our manufactures, merchants, and storekeepers, and
to injure our farmers, &amp;c.? How have foreigners obtained
above 30,000,000 of our stocks, but by manufactures?
The importation of manufactures is now much diminished,
and manufactures are rising, and the price of labour falling.
Will, however, any prudent man commence manufacturing
till shielded [464] from a glut? Our manufactures,
till then, cannot prosper, and we must remain dependent
on foreigners. If all men relied upon handicraft,
as formerly, then the general rule, before alluded to, would
apply, and we might be supplied by home-spun. Were all
patriots, the nation would prefer home-spun, if even a
little dearer than foreign articles of a similar kind; but,
as many will prefer their own to the general interest, the
general government must, in respect to foreign commerce,
interfere. The farmer in England obtains from 8<i>s.</i> to
10s. a bushel for his wheat; our farmers obtain 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
the manufactures in England amount to about 100,000,000<i>l.</i>
sterling; ours, to less than that amount in dollars.</p>

<p>"The distress occasioned by the sudden reduction
of our circulating medium from 100,000,000 dollars, to
45,000,000 dollars, has reduced all property far below its
intrinsic value; the banks are prosecuting to recover sums
loaned, mortgages are foreclosed, and landholders in
debt are compelled to sell. When an European purchases
land in the western countries, he has to clear and fence,
and to build house and barn and stable, at a great expense.
In the old states, as they are termed, the land is
sold at so much per acre, and the house, barn, &amp;c. are
thrown into the bargain. Land, from four to eight miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
from this city, may be averaged at twenty dollars an acre,
ready to [465] be occupied. Navigation is near; the
market is near; the newspapers, as essential almost to an
Englishman as his breakfast, may be received three times
a-week by market-carts. Society is good; the expense of
a long journey, and a thousand inconveniences experienced
by new settlers, are avoided. Horses and oxen, I
believe, can be bought cheaper in this neighbourhood.
If a man wants to remove his family and to sell, he can
find purchasers more readily than in the western wilds.
Sickness almost always occurs on the first exposure of
new land to the sun. State taxes and county levies fall
heavily on settlers in a new country, requiring public
buildings, roads, bridges, &amp;c.; labour is dear, and not
always attainable. A New England man succeeds in a
new country, because he is a jack-of-all-trades; he can
make his own log-house, mend his cart, &amp;c. There is an
old adage, that "fools build, and wise men purchase."
Suppose 150 acres, purchased in this neighbourhood, at
twenty dollars an acre, making 3,000 dollars, the fencing,
and building, and clearing, would cost at least that sum.
When three or four Englishmen wish to purchase together,
they ought to keep it a secret, and to employ some American,
not in high life, who can be confided in, to sound persons
wanting to sell; for if a stranger offers to buy, it is
immediately reported over all the neighbourhood, and
prices are raised, and it exaggerates the value. Americans
are remarkably shrewd. [466] Englishmen, in general,
are credulous and sanguine. All bargains ought to be
legally formal, under signature and seal.</p>

<p>"Question. Is great Britain capable of sustaining its
national debt for any length of time?</p>

<p>"There are operating against the possibility of this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;The rivalship of manufactures of other nations,
knowledge and skill not being an exclusive advantage.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;The encrease of poor-rates, by a superabundant
population, and reduction of wages.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;The augmentation of payments abroad to British
residents, who avoid taxation by removing to foreign
countries.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;The transfer of sums by the timid and enterprizing,
who, foreseeing embarrassments at home, make
purchases abroad of stock and lands. The British funds
yield less than five per cent.; the French and American
yield six.</p>

<p>"These four causes, combining against British prosperity,
almost preclude the hope of supporting the immense
load of taxes. The army cannot, with safety, be much
diminished, for as discontent increases with the addition
of burthens, the power of the government must be increased.
It is surprising that the "tight little island"
prospers as it does; there cannot be a stronger proof of a
good internal management.</p>

<p>"The industrious classes cannot support, in [467] any
community, more than a certain proportion of drones.
The important question is whether the army, navy, state
creditors, hierarchy, servants, residents abroad, tax-gatherers,
&amp;c. can be supported by the industrious. The
rapid increase of poor rates, evinces that a nation has
arrived at its acme.</p>

<p>"The arrival of monied men in this country, to purchase
lands and to avoid an apprehended convulsion, is ominous
of the approaching crisis. It is painful to forebode misfortune,
and an unwelcome task to predict evil. Could I
anticipate improvements similar to those of Arkwright,
&amp;c. to be long exclusively enjoyed, and were there lands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
still to be cultivated, to support augmenting population,
I could indulge the hope of liquidating the debt. At present
I behold an inverted pyramid, propped by machinery,
which is giving way. Your own journey, your own inquiries,
must make a forcible impression, that present
profits are precarious, and that happiness is alloyed with
apprehensions for the future."</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;During a conversation this day with Dr. Thornton,
of the post-office,<a name="FNanchor_156_53" id="FNanchor_156_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_53" class="fnanchor">156</a> he observed that this city, like
that of ancient Rome, was first peopled with thieves and
assassins, and that, during his residence in it, he had found
more villains than he had seen in any other part of the
world. When he was a magistrate, such instances of unblushing
villainy and want of principle amongst the people
[468] had come to his view, as he could not suppose existed
any where. "There are, however," said the doctor,
"many good men now in it." There is a disposition generally
amongst the citizens to live above their income.
Persons who live as independent gentlemen, often run
into debt with their butchers, &amp;c., to the amount of several
hundred dollars, and delay a year and a half before
they attempt to pay, suffering themselves to be dunned
continually, always promising payment, but never being
punctual in performance, and ultimately paying by instalments
of five, ten, or fifteen dollars; a mode of payment
from which the meanest man in England would shrink.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;I received a farewell visit from Mr. Thompson,
late of Boston, who states that he finds the inducements to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
emigrate much fewer and smaller than he expected.
Society, as it at present exists, shews great want of organization,
great want of religion, honour, and virtue, and
the country generally seems destitute of English comforts
and advantages. Yet he is now about to make a commercial
attempt, by way of experiment, which, if not successful,
he will return into his former sphere, well content to
remain in it, without again wandering five miles from it.
He believes that none of the tables in America afford the
comforts of an English table. He thinks that the government
in its neglect of seminaries entails imperfection on
the people. A bitter sectarian [469] spirit prevails, and
is more vicious than in England, and there is a miserable,
petty feeling of aristocracy. It seems to him that republicanism
is suited only for an infant people.</p>

<p>This evening I took my farewell of the claret club, the
focus of liberal principles and of friendly feelings.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 16th.</i>&mdash;Accompanied by Mr. Elliot and the
Rev. J. Wright, I drove to Mount Eagle, the hired seat of
Ferdinand Fairfax, Esq., on our way to Mount Vernon.
This gentleman, an English lord, gave us an introductory
letter, penned on the top of a post, to the supreme Judge,
Washington, who received us coldly and reluctantly before
he read the letter, and said, "I do not like to see
people on this day, but you may walk round." He then
turned away while Mr. Elliot muttered, "We consider
it no act of impiety to visit the tomb of General Washington,
and thus to come on pilgrimage to the shrine of your
illustrious ancestor." On reading the letter his severity
relaxed, and he sent two of his servants to conduct us to
the tomb, through the house and gardens, and to point
out whatever was curious. The road, through the estate,
leading to the mansion, is rough and worn into gullies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Every thing bespeaks the neglect and apathy of the present
owner. The land is poor; the estate is separated on all
sides by a rail fence, that is, rails split and mortised into
posts; and the gardens are surrounded [470] with evergreen
cedar fences, all of which are the work of the late
General, for whom every thing here seems to mourn.
The house contains nothing curious save the huge old
iron key of the French Bastile, kept in a glass case, and
the recollection of its being once the abode of General
Washington. Instead of carpets, you see Indian matting
on the floors. The furniture is mean and common, and
was brought here by Judge Washington.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house is of wood, sanded over, in
imitation of stone. It suffers for want of paint, while
bricks seem falling from the chimneys without being
replaced. Here are no pictures of any value. The only
likeness of the late General is cut from a Chinese pitcher!
The grass upon the lawn and garden, in front and rear of
the house, is rotting and seeding down; it is never mown.</p>

<p>The tomb containing the General, and his lady, and
brother, and others of this renowned family, might be mistaken
for a dog-kennel, or a mound, much resembling a
potatoe grave in England. It is situated at the extremity
of the garden, and on the brow of a hill. No monument
marks it. Evergreen cedars of Lebanon grow thick upon
it, a branch of which is often stolen as a sacred relique.
I bore away one for the king of England. In like manner
did the Russian minister carry one to his Imperial master,
Alexander. No pilgrim is forbidden [471] thus to pilfer.
The tomb is formed by excavating the earth, and then
arching it over with bricks; three feet of earth is then cast
on to the arch, which completely hides every thing but the
entrance at one end, through a door, formed of half inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
fir board, now rotting away. Such a door would disgrace
an English pig-stye. Were pigs to range here, they would
soon enter the tomb, which was built by the brother of
the late General, the latter of whom is to sleep here until
a national grave is made by lottery. Graves and cathedrals
are raised, in this country, by means of lotteries!</p>

<p>While seated on this monumental hill, I exclaimed with
Gray. "The paths of glory lead but to the grave." Mr.
Elliot replied. "Why, Sir, I look on my grave, <i>already
made</i>, with pleasure, and in the same manner as a weary
traveller does to a down bed at the end of a long journey.
I anticipate, with joy, the rest which there awaits me."
"Such a feeling," said I, "is desirable, but how few the
number of those who so feel!"</p>

<p>We were next taken to the green-houses, which in
winter, are filled with all species of choice exotics, from all
quarters of the earth, gifts to the late General. They
now stand out in front of the green-house, with myrtles,
oranges, and lemons, ripe, and in great abundance.
There are aloes too of enormous size; plantains, mace,
and coffee trees. [472] I gathered ripe coffee, which is
contained in a kind of rich fruit or berry, of delicious
flavor. The pine-apple also bears in the green-house,
but it seemed in a withering state.</p>

<p>The approach to the house is marked by negro huts,
and negroes of all ages, male and female. In the General's
time, all was well managed, particularly the farm and
gardens. He, the Cincinnatus of his time, was up early,
and always vigilant. Now all is ruin, and ruin personified
mourns for him.</p>

<p>The Judge is cold and reserved in his manners, and more
than commonly plain in his dress. He seems to be between
fifty and sixty years of age, of small stature, and lean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
habit of body. His features possess but little expression,
and he is, indeed, as unlike the late General, as any man
in the United States.</p>

<p>After having seen all we wished, we re-entered the house
to thank the Judge, but he appeared no more, simply sending
a message that we were "welcome, and he hoped
pleased." He is, we were informed, an amiable, good
man, but of limited knowledge. We appeared, in his
esteem, as sabbath-breakers. On this account he excused
his inhospitality to us; and, besides, the saying of the late
General, "I would not trust any man an inch beyond
my nose, who would set an open example of sabbath-breaking,"
might rise in his recollection much to our
prejudice. I felt the [473] Judge's answer to us as a reproof,
because I hold it essential to the good of society
that Christian sabbaths should be respected.</p>

<p>The scenery in the neighbourhood of the house and
estate is very interesting. The umbrageous mount, on
which the house stands, is a mile high from the shores of
the great Potowmac, which is here two or three miles
broad.</p>

<p>The British, and all the foreign diplomatic personages,
visited this spot by water, and with the marine band
saluted it with solemn dirges. Our guide told us that
none but <i>great gentlemen</i> were permitted to see the house
and gardens on Sunday. I asked if the Judge preached
or kept a parson? He himself reads prayers, morning
and evening, and therefore keeps no parson.</p>

<p>From an attentive perusal of the American history,
and a close examination of the character of Washington,
says Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, it appears to me that the principal faculty
of his mind was judgment, which always led him to avoid
the dangers of precipitancy, and the errors which some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>times
result from a more vivid and brilliant imagination.
The dictates of that judgment constituted the line of his
conduct, which was of course marked with the most consummate
prudence. This virtue seems never to have deserted
him, either as a statesman or a warrior, in a public
or private capacity. His prudence and caution were particularly
observable in his military career, and, like Pericles,
he never [474] willingly came to an engagement,
when the danger was considerable, and the success very
uncertain; nor did he envy the glory of those Generals,
who are admired and applauded, because their rash enterprizes
have been attended with success. He had many
difficulties to encounter, but these difficulties were readily
surmounted. Patriotism animated him, and prudence
conducted him to triumph. With a limited education
and little patronage, he paved his way to greatness, and
by his virtues, cast a blaze of glory around his character,
which time can only increase, and which posterity must
contemplate with enthusiasm and rapture. There is no
parallel for such a man in the annals of the world; so
singular a combination of virtues with so few vices.
Such disinterested patriotism and such unimpeachable
integrity, with so many temptations to swerve and so
many inducements to betray, were never before united.
Immoveable in the hour of danger, no difficulties could
shake, no terrors appal him. He was always the same,
in the glare of prosperity, and in the gloom of adversity.
Like Fabricius, he could not be moved from the paths of
virtue and honor, and like Epaminondas, he made every
thing bend to the interests of his country. His country
was his idol, and patriotism the predominant feeling of
his mind. Personal aggrandizement and individual resentment
and interest, were alike sacrificed to this over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>whelming
passion, which no difficulty could [475] weaken
and no neglect destroy. Washington was reserved, without
being haughty; religious, without being bigotted;
great in all stations, and sublime in all his actions, whether
he moved in the sphere of domestic obscurity, or employed
his energies in wielding the destinies of his country.
Antiquity would have made him a god. Posterity will
make him more. Every nation can boast of its heroes,
its statesmen, and its bards, but there are few that have
produced their Washingtons. He stands alone in the
history of the world, and will be venerated while virtue
and patriotism have an influence on human action.</p>

<p>"You will, (says the same eulogist,) no doubt, be astonished
to understand, that the remains of this great and
excellent man still repose in a humble sepulchre on the
estate at which he resided, and from which, like Cincinnatus,
he was several times called by his country. The
Americans are certainly not ungrateful, but they seem to
have an aversion to perpetuate a man's name by "monumental
brass," or to express their gratitude by splendid
tombs, or ponderous and magnificent mausolea. Your
long acquaintance with Westminster Abbey, where the
high and the low, the great and the obscure, the good man
and the villain, are alike honoured by their country or
their friends, may, perhaps, draw from you a burst of
indignation, at the imaginary apathy and indifference of
this great republic, to the memory [476] and past services
of its illustrious dead, but I question whether it be not
correct policy. To begin would be to have no end, and
the erection of a monument to Washington might terminate,
as in Russia, with a monument to a dog. Since the
invention of writing, and the present extent of knowledge,
the "storied urn and animated bust," have become almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
useless. History will record with fidelity the illustrious
actions of him who has deserved well of his country, and
his name will be as perpetual as if Pelion had been piled
on Ossa, to preserve his memory. It was doubtless owing
to the want of this art, that the humble tumuli of the
Celts, and the massy pyramids of the Egyptians, were
formed; they had no other mode of expressing their gratitude,
or of perpetuating the memory of their dead. After
all, perhaps, the best monument is "to read their history
in a nation's eyes.</p>

<p>"It is but justice, however, to state, that though the
American government have refused to erect a monument
to the memory of their illustrious hero, his countrymen
have not been quite so fastidious; and the citizens of Baltimore,
with that enthusiasm and public spirit which have
done them so much credit, are now engaged in building
a monument that will, at once, evince their gratitude,
their patriotism, and their taste. It may be safely asserted,
that the Americans pay less attention to the depositories
of their dead, than almost any other nation. [477]
They seem to be no sooner laid in the earth, than they are
forgotten; and the tear of sorrow, and the hand of affection,
neither bedews nor decorates the sward, under which the
friend, the parent, or the relative reposes. Among the
ancients, you will recollect, this was a part of their religion,
and we owe to the tenderness and affection of a
Corinthian nurse for her deceased charge, the rich and
splendid capital which beautifies the Corinthian shaft.
It is in vain to look into the burial grounds of this country,
for the pensive cypress, or the melancholy willow, the
virgin weeping over the urn of her departed lover, or the
mother hanging over the grave of her darling child. No
flower blooms, bedewed with the tear of affection. All is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
waste and dreary, and dead as the sunken grave over
which you pass; and a few stones, on which are engraved
the name and age of the deceased, are all that remain to
manifest the affection of the living, to those who have
passed away and are no more.</p>

<p>"Bushrod Washington, the present proprietor of Mount
Vernon, is the nephew of the General. He seems to be
about 60 years of age, is below the middle size, and apparently
nervous and feeble; his complexion is pale and
cadaverous, but his countenance has the lineaments of
benevolence and good nature. He has long been one of
the judges of the supreme court of the United States, and
has, during that period, discovered no deficiency [478]
in his acquaintance with the law. His decisions are, I
believe, generally correct, though not very remarkable.
I know not whether he ever was distinguished for his eloquence
at the bar; but little seems to be known of his
powers as an advocate or a lawyer, and that little does
not tend to place him much beyond the grade of mediocrity.
Satisfied with the reputation which the fame of his
uncle, the situation he holds, and the wealth he possesses,
cast around him, he feels no motive to exertion, and no
desire to render himself illustrious by his own efforts.
He appears to be one of those men to whom the pleasures
of the domestic circle are more seducing than the fitful,
though captivating splendour which surrounds the temples
of the statesman or the warrior, and he prefers what the
world would term the inglorious repose of domestic felicity,
to the feverish agitation and sickly turmoil of public
life.</p>

<p>"Mount Vernon has become, like Jerusalem and Mecca,
the resort of travellers of all nations, who come within its
vicinity. Veneration and respect for the memory of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
great and illustrious chief, whose body it contains, lead all
who have heard his name, to make a pilgrimage to the
shrine of patriotism and public worth, and to stroll over
the ground which has been consecrated by the repose,
and hallowed by the ashes, of heroism and virtue. A
twig, a flower, or even a stone, becomes interesting,
when taken from the spot [479] where Washington lived
and died, and no man quits it without bearing with him
some memento to exhibit to his family and friends."</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;I was revisited yesterday and to-day by Mr.
Law, who, in speaking of my new acquaintance Mr.
Fairfax, says, "he is an amiable, good, and learned man,
but like Charles II. 'he never said a foolish thing, nor ever
did a wise one.' He is ever unprepared to protect himself
from cheats. This gentleman is the great great grandson
of the famous Sir Thomas Fairfax, Cromwell's favourite
general; he was once the richest man in America, but exchanged
100,000 acres of Virginia land for the same quantity
in the west country, which he was told abounded in
iron, silver, and other mines; he thus parted with a substance
for a shadow."<a name="FNanchor_157_54" id="FNanchor_157_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_54" class="fnanchor">157</a> "He still," says Mr. Elliott,
"possesses 100,000 acres, and one of the warmest and
truest hearts in the world. He was brought up at Mount
Vernon, a favourite of General Washington's, who predicted
great things of him." But, says Mr. Law, he has
long been living in prison bounds. His lady lamented
to us on Sunday her want of a carriage, and the hot walks
she had to make to town. This gentleman's brother,
Thomas Fairfax, Esq., commonly known as Lord Fairfax,
who, in his own right is a British peer, possesses large
unproductive estates, and lives frequently in disgrace,
but both, though lords in England, would feel themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
[480] highly insulted were they so to be addressed here.
Both are staunch republicans.</p>

<p>I yesterday added to my acquaintance a lord-chancellor,
a lord, and two princes of the Ossage nation of Indians,
who with two other chiefs, last week, went in state
(naked) to the Secretary of war, and stamped, and said,
in great anger, they came not here to be cheated out of
their lands. They are fine dignified fellows, speaking
only their own wild language.</p>

<p>Mr. Law, during conversation this day, observed that
if this government would, and he believed they would,
adopt his financial system, the people here would soon
flourish again, and every wild spot become a garden. "Mr.
Crawford, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, although he
has recommended a contrary measure, is exactly of my
opinion. We are both as much alike on this subject as
pea to pea."</p>

<p>I said, "Mr. Law, would not a visit to England be
agreeable? Would it not tend to lengthen your life?"
"O, Sir, it would, but I could not now live in England;
I must be active, and doing that which I deem for the good
of mankind. My opinions would run counter to the
powers which be." "But, Sir," rejoined I, "is it not our
duty to be prudent and to seek the peace of the land we
live in? Because in its peace we shall have peace."</p>

<p>"Certainly! such is the duty of every good man. [481]
Why should he sacrifice himself and family? Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;,
your envoy here, seems suspicious of you on account of
your acquaintance with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. I am sorry Mr. &mdash;&mdash; should
have given such toasts at the dinner on the 4th of
July, in favour of the radicals. What have the radicals
to do with America? These toasts will be sent home by
A&mdash;&mdash;. Envoys have nothing to do but to watch the conduct
of British subjects and give reports. I am sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who is a good, kind-hearted, polite man,
should thus expose himself, and you, and other friends,
to suspicion and misrepresentation."</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;I received the following letter from Mr. Law,
addressed to me at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p class="ralign"><i>Washington, 18th July, 1820.</i></p>
<p class="noidt">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I enclose you a list of garden seeds; if you will make a
statement of the probable amount, I will pay now, or
answer your draft after the purchase. A pound or two
of Swedish turnips and of Norfolk turnips may be added.
I shall be happy to pay every attention to any of my
countrymen coming here, and to give them any information
in my power. I regret that I formed your acquaintance
so late. My hay turns out better than I expected,
and I hope to have four or five acres of turnips, as I am
sowing between my rows of corn. Any farming information
I shall be very thankful [482] for. I remain, with
wishes for a safe and speedy voyage,</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Your most obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">T. Law</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>Pray write to me by what vessel you send the seeds.</p>

<p>The following letter from Edward Meacher, gardener

of Yankee labourers. It is addressed</p>

<p>To Thomas Law, Esq.</p>

<div class="sblockquot">

<p class="ralign"><i>July, 1820.</i></p>
<p class="noidt">Sir,</p>

<p>Considering my ill behaviour towards you the other

against spirituous liquors, such as brandy, rum, gin, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
whiskey, <i>except three drams in the course of each day</i>, as
long as I live with you. Three drams a day will not injure
my health or temper. Upon these conditions I
expect not to displease you in future, which will be a
cause, I hope, for you to encourage me in your employment.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 4em;">From your faithful servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Meacher</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>[483] <i>20th.</i>&mdash;This day I bade farewell to Washington
city and America, and to all the bright and vivid spirits I
found in it.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;In company with Mr. E. Dumbleton, and my
wicked, beautiful, silver grey squirrel, a native of Maryland,
whose brushy tail is his nightcap, and who eats razors,
buttons, bibles, &amp;c., and is therefore sentenced to transportation
for life, I embarked on board the good ship
<i>Minerva</i> of Boston, to Amsterdam bound, and from
Alexandria sailed gently down the great river Potowmac.</p>

<p>After a passage of about 30 days, we arrived at the Isle
of Wight. Here I had the honour to present my most
gracious Sovereign with a precious relic&mdash;a cedar-cane
cut from the grave of General Washington; together with
six gallons of "elegant, mighty fine claret," purposely sent
on a Yankee voyage of 10,000 miles, to ripen for the use
of British royalty.</p>


<h3>[484] CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Having reached home, partially recovered what seemed
irrecoverably gone, my long lost health, and told my story,
there seems little or nothing to add, except a few retrospective
observations, summarily bearing on the preced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ing
descriptions, opinions, and decisions, which throughout
are frankly and fearlessly rendered, chiefly aiming to
enlighten the ignorant, and to abash the wicked. "But,"
says the reader, "to emigrate or not to emigrate? That
is the question!" It is easier to propound than to answer
this inquiry. To seek a refuge from danger, and to fly
from the coming storm, is on the one hand in accordance
with one of the first laws of nature; and on the other hand,
it may be said, that to abandon our hearths, homes, and
altars, because our country mourns and is in trouble, is
cowardly. That numbers have gone, are now going, and
will continue to go, is certain; for when there is a surplus
population, and the hive swarms, what shall set bounds
to the free-born? To those, then, who are inevitably
destined to roam, friendless, homeless, really lone strangers
in a strange land, and to see their old, much-loved homes,
and the tombs of their fathers no more, I would say:
Study the preceding well-meant pages. I know your
wants and feelings. Study, then, I [485] would say, by
every attainable qualification, principle, and sentiment, to
fortify your minds, and make yourselves all which you
ought to be. Plague not yourselves nor the land of your
adoption, by importing and giving perpetuity to homebred
prejudices. A nest you will find; but every where,
like that of the nightingale, a thorn within it. Learn,
therefore, yourselves to forget, and as far as in you lies,
teach your posterity also to forget, and to remember only
what they ought to remember. A British origin will be
ever honourable in their heraldry. This is well worth
remembrance, and may they never stain, never dishonour
it; but into whatsoever lands they wander, may they seek
the good and peace of that land, for in its good and peace
they shall have peace themselves!</p>

<p>To those whose disgusts and moral and physical dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>abilities
point them homewards, as prodigals to the house
of their fathers, the broad Atlantic, in the words of the
Hon. J. Q. Adams, offers a highway for their return; having
undergone a process by which they shall, perhaps, learn
the vast sum and value of English homes and comforts.</p>

<p>The old family quarrel has evidently made the natives
of both countries somewhat incommiscible; else how is it
that the French, Dutch, Germans, Irish, and strangers of
any other land, are more acceptable to America than the
children of the common parent, Great Britain. For to
the latter the most distinguished Americans have heretofore
[486] proudly traced their pedigree, unless some rank
and cancerous blemish was in the root and core of it.
Hence all grades blush not to own and call her mother,
though she is denounced by many, and it must be owned
with some justice, as an unnatural parent. But those
events have long since become matter of historical record,
and it is not good policy to visit the sins of the fathers upon
the children, from generation to generation. Let both
countries wisely learn to think correctly of their several
governments, and kindly of each other. Peace and goodwill,
in all their fruitful ramifications, will ever bring more
silver dollars to the one, and more golden guineas to the
other, than fire-ships, torpedos, battles, blazing cities,
and heroes covered with glory!</p>

<p>"Well! I guess, after all," exclaimed a Yankee friend,
"it is a good land with small faults; necessary evils;
seeming evils; good in disguise." "Yes, it is a good land,"
rejoined another, in love with it at first sight, "mine eyes
have seen it for myself, and not another. I am fascinated
with it. My return from it would be impossible, but for
the adamantine chain which binds me to my country.
My heart tempts me, but my duty forbids me to break it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Hasty conclusions like hasty matches, are rarely happy,
and so it was with our enthusiast; for in less than two
years of patient trial and perpetual travel, he very gladly
returned to his native country, joyfully repeating,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">[487] &mdash;&mdash;"Whoe'er thou art,</span><br />
Cling to thy home. If there the meanest shed<br />
Yield thee a hearth and shelter for thy head,<br />
And some poor plot with vegetables stor'd,<br />
Be all that heav'n allots thee for thy board,<br />
Unsavoury bread, and herbs that scatter'd grow<br />
Wild on the river bank, or mountain brow,<br />
Yet ev'n this cheerless mansion shall provide<br />
More heart's repose than all the world beside."<br />
</p>

<p>Finally; were, however, America, of which I now perhaps
take my leave for ever, every thing that the purest
patriotism could make it, yet the climate is an evil, a perpetual
evil, a mighty drawback, an almost insurmountable
obstacle to the health, wealth, and well-being of all, except
the native red and black man, the genuine aboriginal,
and the unstained African, for whom alone this land of
promise, this vast section of the earth, this new and better
world, seems by nature to have been intended. Otherwise,
it is argued, would noisome pestilence annually
desolate its cities and districts, and every where unsparingly
and prematurely people the grave? In spite, however,
of climes, tropical or changeful, torrid or frigid, and
of constitutional predisposition to sickness, health, physical
and moral, is much more at the command of mankind than
she is generally supposed to be. Temperance, abstinence,
and exertion, approximating to labour, in free air, are the
essential handmaids to health, and enable a man to laugh
at doctors, and to withstand the effects of climate. Hence,
then, [488] in whatsoever climes, stations, or circumstances,
my reader may be found, let him learn to think health
worth a sacrifice. To persons, whose fortune it may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
to encounter the risks of this dangerous and debilitating
climate, I would especially say: Let ablutions and affusions
of pure, cold spring water, become habitual with
you, and as a beverage, let water be substituted for wine,
whiskey, and alcohol in all its forms. Let milk supply
the place of tea, coffee, and other stimulants; and let
tobacco, snuff, and all the family of narcotics, be abandoned.
Surely health is ever, what a late venerable friend
of his species was often wont to call her, <i>the Sugar of Life</i>.
He who thinks and acts otherwise rarely finds health, and
never deserves her.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Ever since the period of our war with North America,
which ended in the independence of the United States, the
attention of Europe has been intensely drawn to that portion
of the globe; and many Philanthropists have entertained
sanguine hopes that the declaration of Independence
was the commencement of a new era of radical improvement
to mankind&mdash;that the old Governments of the
world, full of abuses, and unable to stand before the light
of the new Republic, must soon fall before it; and that
from America would triumphantly arise the Genius of
true liberty, to glad and improve the condition of the
nations of the earth. So ably were the whole negotiations
conducted on the adverse side, both before [viii] and after
the war, by a few shrewd and determined minds; and so
effectually was the war concluded by a Washington, that
the people of the old continent fancied the new one must
be covered by Statesmen and Warriors, and hailed the
approaching amelioration of mankind from the bright
examples these were to send forth.</p>

<p>'Tis true the subsequent conduct of the Republicans,
both to their leaders and towards ourselves, did not tend
to keep up the admiration which had been raised; yet,
other causes&mdash;the late events in Europe, having brought
governments there into great difficulties, and multitudes
of the people, from the intoxication of a short-lived prosperity,
eventually to drain the cups of privation and
poverty, many of these naturally turned their attention to
other countries; and leaving their own, sought on foreign
shores those comforts they had lost at home. American
liberty again became the theme of a class of politicians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
among us; travellers of inquiry again went out to make
observations; published their accounts, mostly of flattering
import, and in consequence, [ix] ship-loads of emigrants
from all the countries of Europe were constantly arriving
in the ports of the new Republic.</p>

<p>One of the latest among the crowd of travellers who thus
have set the fashion of emigration (Mr. Morris Birkbeck)
has published his account, and has met with the greatest
success in influencing the minds of his countrymen;&mdash;his
"Letters from the Illinois," and previous "Journal," are
written in a plain concise style, and yet dictated at the same
time by an unperceived romantic sanguine temperament
which always gives so beautiful a colouring to nature, and
produces a work most fascinating to the mind.</p>

<p>These favourable accounts, aided by a period of real
privation and discontent in Europe, caused emigration to
increase tenfold; and though various reports of unfavourable
nature soon circulated, and many who had emigrated
actually returned to their native land in disgust, yet still
the trading vessels were filled with passengers of all ages
and descriptions, full of hope, looking forward to the West
as to a land of liberty and [x] delight&mdash;a land flowing
with milk and honey&mdash;a second land of Canaan.</p>

<p>To inquire into the truth of so inviting a prospect as
that held up by Mr. Birkbeck and some others, and in
part to relieve the mind from evils of a domestic nature,
the Author was induced in the year 1819 to embark for
North America: he took in his hand the flattering accounts
in print in order to compare them with his own actual
observations; with the intent either to add his confirmation
to the favourable side, or otherwise to exert his utmost
to undeceive the many of his countrymen misled by
specious reports.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>With these views the journey was undertaken, and the
annexed pages are the result; in perusing which the reader
is requested to observe, that he will not find, strictly speaking,
an emigrant's guide through the country, (although
there are hints which it is hoped may be found useful,)
but chiefly facts and reflections for consideration previous
to going thither under the inducements held out by
Mr. Birkbeck and others:&mdash;These hints, the Author is
conscious, have not been conveyed [xi] in the most pleasing
form, but he trusts, that if the matter be found important
the manner will not be looked upon with the severity of a
critic's eye.</p>

<p>To the Americans the Author wishes to address a few
words, in order to assure them that, in the following
observations, he has fully intended to guide his pen by
the spirit of his motto: nor does he think them at all to
blame in not coming up to the perfect model of a Republican
which may be mentally pourtrayed; but rather ourselves
are wrong in forgetting that they are not only men,
but men placed in a new country, with all its difficulties,
natural and moral, to overcome. If I picture to myself
a giant and find a man of but ordinary proportions, is he
to blame for this? Certainly not. The North Americans
possess a fertile beautiful country and a fine climate: no
one can wish for the improvement and the true enjoyment
of these advantages more than the Author; he the more
laments the apparent presence among them of a huge
portion of blind conceit in their own superiority, and also
the absence of the very essential Christian principle of
good-will and benevolence; [xii] under the influence of
which the truly great hold out the hand of good fellowship
to the rest of mankind, regard them as brothers, and wish
for "peace on earth, good-will toward men."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_VOYAGE1" id="THE_VOYAGE1"></a>THE VOYAGE<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">1</a></h3>


<p>May 5th. Off Margate on board the Venus, bound for
New York. This ship, which was to have sailed on 29th
April, did not drop down the river until the 1st instant;
and then, owing to an accident which befel the Steam
Tug, did not reach Gravesend until Sunday the 2d. We
had meanwhile repaired thither, and remained smarting
under the extortionate charges of a Gravesend tavern.
At length, on the Monday evening, the signal was displayed
for sailing, and trunks, &amp;c. having been previously sent
on board, we took a [2] long leave of English ground, and
proceeded with other passengers to the ship; expecting,
like unfledged Voyagers, to find everything in trim to receive
us.</p>

<p>When agreeing with the Captain for the passage, I had
inquired if there were many other passengers, and was
then told there were "<i>a few</i>;" previous to going on board
the "few" had increased to "as many as convenient;"
notwithstanding this hint, so inexperienced were we, that
we were not in the slightest manner prepared for the scene
presented to our appalled senses on rising the ship's side!
Trunks, portmanteaus, packages of all kinds and descriptions,
piled in all directions and in every way&mdash;a crowd
of dirty squalid steerage passengers, which appeared to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
our magnifying eyes at least five times the real number,
(about 80)&mdash;altogether formed a mass through which
we could not, without much difficulty, push our way to the
cabin; and that accomplished, still more horrors presented
themselves to view: instead of the carpet and good order
which reigned there when I had examined the vessel while
in dock, the dirty floor was covered now with nothing but
trunks, bedding, and other baggage; giving an effect the
most forlorn and petrifying to us all: so that we sat down
upon broken chair, box, trunk, or anything we could, and
glared upon each other [3] desponding as the fallen angels
at their first drop!</p>

<p>Our fate, however, not merited like their's,&mdash;no; but
we regarded our Captain as the arch-fiend and tormentor,
and we gave him looks of reproach which pretty plainly
said, "you have entrapped us into your abominable pit
this time, but if we ever get out you will not do so again:"&mdash;However,
I will not suppose he enjoyed our horror, but
rather partook a little of the general feeling; for he sat,
his eyes glaring as wildly as any of the party until at length,
as nothing was offered to relieve the spirits, I proposed a
biscuit and some porter, which were brought, and nearly
in silence consumed; after which we each turned in for the
night, and sought repose.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>While engaged this morning writing the above in the
cabin, the ship floating easily along under a pleasant little
breeze, we suddenly felt a shock, followed by a rubbing
along the bottom; the Captain started up, and was upon
deck in a moment; the passengers ran in all directions,
and the appalling cry "we are aground" sounded on all
sides! Happily, though such a mixed multitude, even
the females betrayed but little fear, and most of the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
lent every aid in their power; the [4] weather was favorable,
and though the ship beat much, the bottom being sand
and the tide rising, great hopes were entertained that she
would get off. Had it happened in the night and the
wind had come on to blow hard, we should in all probability
have been lost; being day, we were descried from the
shore, distant about ten miles, and boats of fishermen soon
arrived to render assistance; but now a long previous
altercation ensued between them and the Captain, before
a bargain was struck: for a service which they acknowledged
would not occupy more than half an hour, they first
asked one hundred, and then sixty guineas.&mdash;Such is
man when the consideration is the property of his fellow!
Our lives they did not contemplate to be in danger, otherwise
to save them these same men would have risked their
own without thought of reward: so let us be in charity
with human nature yet. At length, after an anxious interval
to the passengers, it was agreed that fifty guineas
should be the price for getting the ship afloat; the word
was given, and in twenty minutes of alacrity the bower
anchor was carried out; the men exerted themselves at
the capstern; the ship's head swung round; and after three
or four violent bumps of the stern upon the sand she
heeled off and swam again. Those who have experienced
such accidents may know how people [5] feel at
such a moment; mutual congratulations went round accompanied
with internal thankfulness to that Providence,
whose care is over all.<a name="FNanchor_2_56" id="FNanchor_2_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_56" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>6th. Off Deal. A lovely morning, well calculated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
remove from the mind the impressions of the preceding
day; a clear view of the town; and the French coast also
is very visible from the deck.</p>

<p>In order to attain the important objects of health and
security among so promiscuous an assemblage, the cabin
passengers met at the instance of the Captain, and a set
of resolutions was drawn up for the general observance;
and a copy being handed to those of the steerage, was
acceded to by them and this morning put in force:&mdash;by
these rules, one captain of the day from the cabin, and
another from the steerage were on duty by rotation,&mdash;candles
were put out at a fixed hour,&mdash;the parts of the
deck for the use of the cabin and steerage passengers were
prescribed; and sundry rules for cleanliness, which were
afterwards but ill obeyed: no forfeitures were necessary,
as the captains of trading vessels have by law the power
[6] of punishment; as far at least as putting in irons for
misconduct, and indeed this was inflicted in the course
of the voyage, upon a riotous tailor.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>, 9th. Light airs with mist hitherto; wind this
morning rather more favorable. Prayers read upon deck
by one of the passengers.</p>

<p>We are now clear of the Channel, and drifting upon the
vast wilderness of waters, a plank our dependence until
we may reach a new continent. To sailors of course, a circumstance
so common brings little reflection, but those
to whom the situation is new, must confess a sensation
most awful and uneasy: certain it is we are equally in
the hands of a beneficent Providence, whether we tread
the seemingly firm-set earth, or commit ourselves as now
upon this immense ocean; but it is in vain for philosophy
to disguise&mdash;she cannot subdue feeling.</p>

<p>10th. We are now first experiencing a calm attended
by a heavy swell of the sea;&mdash;the sailors call this "Paddy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Hurricane," and Paddy was right, for the rolling of the
Ship, racking of masts, flapping of sails, &amp;c. render it anything
but a <i>calm</i> on board.</p>

<p>Of our cabin party it is not necessary to record the views;
suffice it, that it consists of three ladies and six gentlemen,
besides six children; some for pleasure and health, others
for business bound.</p>

<p>[7] The passengers in the steerage are far too numerous
either for their own comfort or ours; many of them seem
very respectable people, farmers, farm-servants, hop-planters,
masons, carpenters, and tailors, with their wives
and children. I cannot perceive the tenable policy of
throwing obstacles in the way of emigration of such people;
as England is overstocked with artisans, and other countries
are in want of them, it is surely a mutual benefit;
and to prevent individuals seeking the best market for
their craft is the highest injustice.</p>

<p>12th. Being fine and calm in the mid-day, the Hold
was opened and various packages got up for examination
and re-stowage; while this was doing, and loose straw
laying about on deck, there was a cry "the Caboose is
on fire!" This only occasioned a momentary panic, as
<i>luckily</i> no harm arose from it; the chimney was foul, and
some fat taking fire had communicated to the soot, and
from thence nearly to the main-sheet.</p>

<p>This day we took up a cask which upon tapping proved
full of excellent brandy; it was covered with barnacles,
and had probably been floating four or five months.</p>

<p>15th. A Hawk of a small kind, resembling the Sparrow
Hawk of England, was this morning caught in the rigging;
the nearest land being supposed above three hundred miles
renders this an [8] extraordinary circumstance: we also
saw yesterday a large brown bird pursuing a Gull, and
understood its name to be Rump-poke. An appropriate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
appellation, as it pursues other birds for their droppings,
which it catches as they fall and feeds upon.</p>

<p>18th. We have experienced so many head winds and
calms that the spirits of all, not excepting the Captain, are
cast down,&mdash;two thousand five hundred miles yet to run.
Yesterday a lady a cabin passenger, was safely delivered
of a boy her first child.</p>

<p>22d. Favorable breezes. A quarrel between the cook
and a sailor, in which the former knocked out three of the
latter's teeth with a billet of wood; and for which he underwent
a severe <i>cobbing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_57" id="FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_57" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>24th. Two Whales of the Grampus kind rose near the
vessel. At 7 <small>A. M.</small> a large fish was seen to pass the ship
tormented by a shoal of small ones; the Captain ordered
the boat down, went out, struck it, and it was got on
board; it proved to be a Sun-fish that weighed one hundred
weight and a half: it was quickly cut to pieces, dressed,
[9] and eaten by the ship's company and some of the
passengers; the flesh very white and firm.</p>


<h3>SHIP COOKERY</h3>

<p>Anything but clean,&mdash;anything but simple,&mdash;anything
but what one is used to.</p>


<h3>SITUATION OF A PASSENGER ON BOARD
SHIP</h3>

<p>Some risk,&mdash;little comfort,&mdash;a total inversion of all
accustomed habits,&mdash;a feeling of insecurity,&mdash;irritability,&mdash;a
longing to be ashore; in short, a total <i>be-blue-devil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>ment</i>
at times, with a few hours of pleasanter colour just
to keep hope alive.</p>

<p>The ignorance and simplicity of some of the passengers
are greater than might be supposed; one said the other
day he supposed we had five hundred miles yet to go, and
another asked me if America was mountainous.</p>

<p>26th. A tremendous wave broke over us, giving the
ship such a shock as laid her down on her side. Great
was the confusion; trunks thrown upon trunks, tables,
chairs, all forced from their [10] mooring, in spite of bolts
and ropes; we were glad to find however that, excepting
the fracture of glasses and crockery, no material accident
had happened to any one.</p>

<p>About this time an account of each steerage passenger's
stock of provisions was taken, and though but three weeks
out, several were found nearly exhausted; so improvident
had they been.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>The following list of sea stores is recommended as
sufficient for a steerage passenger.</p>

<p>A passenger provided as above will not experience
want in any common passage, and indeed there are some
articles with which he may dispense; as, for example, the
Porter; and others he may lessen, as the Potatoes <i>perhaps</i>.
With respect to medicine, it may be as well to provide
some Epsom salts and magnesia, and a few lemons will
be found highly grateful; otherwise the ship always carries
a chest containing the common remedies.</p>

<p>31st. The wind blew what the sailors call a strong
breeze, which is in fact a gale, from the west; the ship
laboured much, and such was the impression upon the
minds of many of the steerage passengers, that at night
they took leave of each other, thinking it not likely the
vessel should live through the night.</p>

<p>[12] <i>June</i> 1st. With the prospect of a protracted passage,
an inspection was also judged necessary of the
ship's cabin stores; and such waste and extravagance
was proved against the Steward, that it was resolved to
take into our own hands the ordering of each day's provisions:
a meeting was consequently held, an account of
stock taken; and ordered, that one of the party by rotation
should superintend each day's consumption of food; and
also of water, which had likewise been used very extrava<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>gantly.
Let those going a voyage not only ascertain their
<i>sort</i> of Captain but their <i>sort</i> of Steward, upon whom I
can assure them a very material share of their comfort
will depend.</p>

<p>The general subject of conversation now is, calculating
the probable duration of the passage; yet it is essential
to comfort during a voyage to abstract the mind as much
as possible from such reflections, and to engage it as much
as in us lies in some useful studies and occupations&mdash;'tis
one of the worst to watch the winds and the waves;
'tis one of the most useless, for we cannot command them.</p>

<p>We are, it is supposed, approaching the great bank of
Newfoundland: as much doubt exists as to the accuracy
of the dead reckoning of longitude, (and we have no
other,) our anxiety is great [13] to ascertain the passage
over the bank, by which a new departure may be taken.</p>

<p>8th. It is now the general opinion, in which the Captain
coincides, that we have passed, without knowing
when, the great Bank; the weather is warmly tempered
by a fine S. W. breeze, and the ship is wafting us delightfully
over summer seas: hope again "tells a flattering
tale" and conversation runs chiefly on what will be done,
and what will be had, on our arrival at the much-desired
Port.</p>

<p>Last night the full moon exhibited, through a heavy
mist, an appearance of several rings of the prismatic
colours,&mdash;a beautiful effect, which I remember once before
to have witnessed in England.</p>

<p>11th. Spoke the brig Spring, of Blyth, homeward
bound; and had the no small satisfaction to find that her
calculation of longitude nearly agreed with our own late
suppositions.</p>

<p>This morning the extraordinary conflict between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
fish called the Thresher and a Whale was seen near the
vessel; the Thresher repeatedly raised itself on the Whale's
back, so that its tail was nearly upright, and struck the
Whale violently with it on the head; it is said that the
Pilot-fish is at the same time wounding him underneath
with his sword-snout: they did not however succeed this
time, but relinquished their pursuit at the noise [14]
which the people made at the extraordinary spectacle.
The Thresher appeared to be about six or seven feet long.</p>

<p>16th. A Shark seen in early morning: and a large
Sword-fish swam majestically round the ship's bow, probably
taking it for a Whale; but finding his mistake he
dropt astern, and soon after a shoal of small fish, perhaps
endeavouring to avoid him, rose completely out of the
water;&mdash;his length was about nine feet as we judged,
and his form and colours beautiful. Several kinds of birds
have lately been seen; among which we viewed with pleasure
the "Hagdown" as the sailors say it is always seen
on or near soundings; it is about the size of, and somewhat
resembles, a Duck.&mdash;Many Porpoises too have
lately passed us; one of these the men struck, and succeeded
in getting it on board, when it was soon cut up and eaten;
we were prevailed upon to taste it, and must acknowledge
that it could not have been distinguished from a fine beef
steak; the gravy was indeed richer.</p>

<p>18th. The events of the voyage have lately been
harassing and pregnant with danger; three officers have
kept reckonings of longitude, and all have proved erroneous;
the ship has headed them considerably, and, when
we little thought of our danger, has been near wrecked
upon one of the dangerous shoals off Nantucket; the
grave of [15] many a good vessel. Our escape was providential:
during breakfast, the Captain, with seeming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
presentiment, suddenly went upon deck while the lead
was throwing; he made the next cast himself, which he
had no sooner done than he let it go&mdash;gave the word
"'Bout ship"&mdash;ran himself to assist, and notwithstanding
the great confusion, it was quickly effected;&mdash;the
steersman called out "What point?"&mdash;answer, "Out as
you came in," and in twenty minutes we had deepened
again as many fathoms! Had this happened during the
night, or had the sea been rough, we should, in all human
probability, never have been heard of again. It was conjectured,
that we had been upon the edge of what is called
"Fisher's Rip," and the water when the ship was put
about had suddenly shoaled to less than three fathoms.</p>

<p>We stood a southerly course until midnight, in order to
avoid the breakers which lie out forty miles south from
Nantucket; and then tacked again.</p>

<p>19th. More alarms,&mdash;yester-evening the Boatswain
suddenly called out "shoal-water!" the line was immediately
thrown, but the depth proved twenty-five fathoms:
at half past nine <small>P. M.</small> one of those storms which are I
suppose frequent in this new world, passed over us, and
most awfully grand was its transit. At eight <small>P. M.</small> the
ship was just put about under a [16] clear serene starlight,&mdash;not
five minutes had elapsed when we heard great
noise and confusion upon deck, and running up saw the
sky covered with the tremendous cloud-storm; throwing
its black mantle across from E. to W. and dipping its
points like wings into the opposite sides of the horizon.
The sails were flying in all directions, and the men clueing
them up as fast as they could, while the ship was turning
round at the mercy of the whirlwind; providentially, the
extreme violence of the storm passed above us, and even
while we beheld it, the dense vapour seemed to vanish from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the sight instantaneously; leaving upon our minds the
effect of enchantment.</p>

<p>Six o'clock <small>P. M.</small> not yet quit of terrors; another storm,
the extreme force of which we have again been spared,
has just past over, but its effects continue; it rains violently,
and lightens incessantly.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>, 20th, four <small>A. M.</small> Land at length seen on starboard
quarter, which proved to be Long Island: the sun
arose and brought with it a day and breezes the most
favorable, under which we ranged along the coast of the
Island, at about seven miles' distance, having a view of
it which imagination made delightful. Various schooners,
brigs, and other shipping are in view, working [17] different
ways, and our recent alarms are forgotten in the beauty
and grandeur of the scene.</p>

<p>Before night we passed Sandy Hook, were boarded by
a pilot, who took us up the Bay about six miles and then
cast anchor for the night: once more then surrounded by
land, the outline of which was indistinctly seen by the
aid of an azure sky thickly studded with stars, we at
length retired to rest, and undisturbed by noise slept
profoundly.</p>

<p>21st. The ship dropped anchor again opposite the
Quarantine ground, where it was necessary to undergo
an examination of the births previous to obtaining permission
to gain the much desired Port. A party of us
took this opportunity to go on shore, and after seven
weeks' confinement to enjoy again a walk on land. We
procured clams, oysters, milk, new bread, &amp;c. loaded
with which we returned well pleased on board. The
houses here are chiefly frames covered with boards, having
lean-to sheds roofed like the houses with shingles, the
best being made of cedar; under these sheds the inhabi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>tants
sit and enjoy the cool breezes, unannoyed by the
scorching rays of the sun: cherry and peach are the principal
trees around these dwellings, except the weeping-willow
and formal Lombardy poplar; these last one would
suppose the least likely [18] to be cultivated in a country
where shade is more a necessary comfort than to be called
a luxury.</p>

<p>This morning in working up to the Quarantine ground,
we passed a schooner, or rather the remains of one (for
it was a mere wreck,) which had suffered in one of those
black squalls that had passed over us; she had only a stump
of a mast left, to which her remaining sail was tied.</p>

<p>22d. After some difficulty in obtaining the permit for
our departure from the Quarantine hospital, (which the
filthy state of several of the steerage births amply justified,)
we at length weighed anchor for the last time, with
a favourable and light breeze, affording leisure to admire
the beautiful surrounding scenery of the Bay, and soon
brought-to off the city of <span class="smcap">New York</span>;&mdash;an officer of the
customs came on board; he appeared a very respectable
man, and behaved very politely to the passengers; at the
same time was strict in his duty and superior to a bribe.<a name="FNanchor_4_58" id="FNanchor_4_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_58" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Our fees at the custom-house on clearing were altogether
half a dollar and twenty [19] cents: on leaving England
we had paid the Captain for doing the same for us three
pounds. This was probably <i>good pay</i> for the trouble,
and indeed I should recommend every passenger not to
be above managing this affair for himself, if he values
money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>23d. The heat of the weather in the city is so oppressive
to English constitutions, that we have established ourselves
across the river, on the Jersey shore, at a very pleasant
place called Hoboken;&mdash;here we pay 7$ per week
each, for board and lodging, and have a quick and pleasant
communication with New York by steam ferry-boats
every hour during the day to and from it.</p>

<p>On entering our present boarding-house to inquire
their terms, &amp;c. we encountered the first striking specimen
of the effects of freedom without refinement; upon
asking for the Landlord, a young woman who was sweeping
the floor slip-shod, desired us to walk into a room she
pointed to; where, she said, we might wait for further
orders!! We did as we were ordered, reflecting on this
contrast to a good English inn where, upon the traveller's
arrival, from the Landlord down to "Boots,"<a name="FNanchor_5_59" id="FNanchor_5_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_59" class="fnanchor">5</a> all are
immediately [20] upon the alert ready and willing to attend
to your wishes.</p>

<p>One reason for this want of attention in the American
servants is, that they are paid wholly by their employers,
and expect no compensation from their guests; though, I
have since seen enough to convince me that this praiseworthy
custom is gradually wearing away, and that in
general the servants will not refuse a fee when offered.</p>

<p>Called at a working cutler's near the post-office, to
purchase a pocket knife; he asked two dollars for one
which in London would be sold for about four shillings;
said he paid rent for his shop alone 400$, and that fuel
cost him during the winter seven shillings sterling per week.</p>

<p>The Americans at New York have not made a favourable
impression upon me: almost every face expresses the
game of desperate speculation. I am told that this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
owing to the general distress of mercantile affairs consequent
to the late war with England; and also the effects
of the French revolution, felt upon both continents, but
in a much higher degree in America, as that country was
less able to bear up against it;&mdash;the people here like
those of England were beyond measure extravagant under
the deceitful prosperity, and they now doubly feel the
dreadful re-action. Besides, like ancient Rome, here is
the asylum of [21] the desperate and discontented of all
nations:&mdash;Will the period arrive when, like the former,
this modern Rome shall rule mistress of the globe? It is,
if I may venture to judge, at all events very distant; they
must first gain the necessary qualities for the attainment
of such an elevation; at present, of these they are nearly
destitute. But to return to my journal.</p>

<p>Business here, with the exception of a few respectable
houses, is conducted on an apparently slovenly plan;
clerks at their banks look like our tavern waiters in deshabille,
and the bankers themselves not in appearance so
respectable as our clerks.</p>

<p>The town is handsomely built, and several things constantly
remind one that here the people rule, and their
convenience and comfort are studied: the footways for
example are in general twice as broad as ours, in some
instances taking up at least as much of the street as that
set apart for the carriages; and the hackney coaches are
not only neat but <i>elegant</i> in our sense of the word, and both
drivers and horses equally superior. In a late publication,<a name="FNanchor_6_60" id="FNanchor_6_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_60" class="fnanchor">6</a>
it is observed that the goods in the stores are set
out in a slovenly manner; [22] my own observation is that
their shops or stores are apparently as good, and the stock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
as well shewn as in many good houses in London: their
coffee-houses and dinner-rooms in the best lodging-houses
are even superbly fitted up, very much in the
French style: the Tontine, the City, and the Bank-coffeehouses
are three of the first; and a person may now dine
at any one of them, I believe, for three dollars and a half
per week, and fare sumptuously upon turtle, &amp;c. every
day;&mdash;wine is but little drank, or any other liquor indeed,
either at or immediately after dinner by Americans;
the reason for this, as given to me by an American, seems
good&mdash;"We consider dinner as a sufficient stimulus"
says he "without adding wine or spirits to it."</p>

<p>The business of the courts of justice during the summer
is done in the evenings and nights; the great heat of
the weather in the day time absolutely preventing any
number of people from collecting together without danger
of fevers, particularly such persons as compose the witnesses,
auditors, and attendants in a law court.</p>

<p>Mr. Fearon states, that forgery of bank notes is unknown
here, for, that the execution of them is so excellent
(I write the sense of his words from memory) it renders
it too difficult to attempt.&mdash;I can affirm that there was
scarcely a store I [23] went into at New York, but they
could shew me several; and so well executed, it was impossible
for me to see any difference between the valid
and the forged note.</p>


<h3>A DRIVE TO THE FALLS OF THE PASSAIC
RIVER, JERSEY STATE</h3>

<p>Leaving Hoboken on the Delaware, we proceed along
a good road with some romantic scenery of rock, wood,
and water, through the town of Hackensac to the village<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of Paterson; where we found a good tavern and an attentive
Landlord, a very remarkable character in the United
States: after dining at the table d'hote, which was very
well provided, we set out to walk to the falls, a mile distant,
under a burning sun, which made it appear at least
two. The beautiful clear stream of the gentle Passaic
here suddenly rushes down two perpendicular fissures in
the granite rock; making a grand fall at each, of about
one hundred feet, into a capacious basin beneath; from
thence recovering, it murmurs along a stony bed a mile
or two, when resuming [24] a placid course it winds
through a country thickly settled, the inhabitants chiefly
Dutch and Germans; and gliding by the towns of Belville
and Newark finally mingles its waters with the Delaware.
The views near Belville, and on the road to it on the banks
of the Passaic, are very fine: but the whole way the
black population were so numerous as to be quite oppressive
to the eye unaccustomed to it; every house we passed
presented a group of black heads huddled together glaring
at us:&mdash;But the beautiful Passaic has floated us away
from its falls too soon; we must just return thither to say
that we ascended by steps made for the purpose to the
top of the rocks, from whence the river is precipitated.
Here are some wide yawning clefts of great depth, and one
of them occasioned a dreadful catastrophe not long
before our coming: a new-married couple accompanied a
party to the falls, and after admiring the tremendous
broken and precipitous rocks and chasms, were returning
in order to descend; when the bride ran back, as she said,
to take a last view, and heedlessly going too near to the
edge of the yawning cleft fell into it in sight of her husband,
who in vain rushed to save her&mdash;she was seen no more!</p>

<p>On returning to the tavern at Paterson, I asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
little shabby bare-footed boy, our guide, [25] whether he
worked at a wool manufactory we were passing, "No,"
said he, rather bluntly; "I go to school; my father's a
'squire:" thinking I did not hear correctly, I repeated the
question and received the same answer. "And pray
what is a 'squire, what does he do?" "Oh, he attends
sessions, trials, and hears causes." "And what may your
father do at other times?" "He <i>assists</i> Mr. ******* at
the tavern there, in the bar!"</p>

<p>We returned to Hoboken by the town of Belville; day
departed long before we got back, and night came on, its
darkness beautifully relieved by the novel effect of the
fire-fly, myriads of which were darting in perpetual motion;
and in all directions filling the air and the surface of the
low grounds with brilliant illumination.</p>

<p>We met on the road many small light waggons drawn
by two horses harnessed to a pole, which are here by the
country people used generally: in these the farmer and his
family travel at a brisk pace and very commodiously;&mdash;at
a distance I at first fancied a handsome Phaeton approaching,
as they drove towards us; indeed, away from
the city every one seems comfortable and independent;
we see no misery, no disgusting army of paupers, not even
a beggar to be seen:<a name="FNanchor_7_61" id="FNanchor_7_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_61" class="fnanchor">7</a> we have, however, [26] already discovered
that this country is not entitled to a character
for cheap living; for many articles, particularly those of
luxury, you pay at least as much as in England, the difference
consisting in this, (a very material one to the seller,)
that here, the whole price of the commodity goes into the
pocket; there, a heavy tax is paid in some shape or other
out of every article sold: for example, the hire of a gig and
horse for the day is here thirteen shillings and sixpence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sterling; the owner puts the whole of this into his pocket,
for there is no duty to government; whereas in England we
all know too well that there is an enormous one, besides
an assessed tax for both carriage and horse. Wine here,
though of course to be bought much cheaper by the
private consumer, is charged at least a dollar and a half
per bottle at a public boarding-house, though the duty on
importation is trifling; in England the price is the same,
notwithstanding the high duties. As another instance,
washing is done here from three shillings and sixpence
to four shillings and sixpence sterling per dozen, of everything
indiscriminately; though soap is not half the price
it is in England, where the same quantity may be washed
for two shillings.</p>

<p>From the above examples, and many more I could
mention, it would appear that the man who should emigrate
to this country to <i>spend</i> an income, [27] might not
gain by the change; it is equally evident that the individual
who goes to <i>make money</i> may be benefited.</p>

<p>4th. Sunday here presents a most pleasing contemplation;
the people before united in trade and political government,
are now seen shedding out quietly and in utmost
harmony, repairing to the places of worship of their several
persuasions: the English protestant establishment
seems to be well attended; the service with a few alterations,
and the (perhaps) well-judged omission of our frequent
repetitions, was very impressively read to an attentive
congregation. The places for worship are generally
strongly and, though plainly, handsomely constructed;
yet not perhaps, strictly according with the best rules of
architecture.</p>

<p>We cannot but observe a very striking flatness or insipidity
of character pervading the population, which is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
perhaps to be attributed to bad times, but to various other
causes: I am apt to believe that a large portion bear expatriation
with a sort of melancholy feeling&mdash;America
is not yet their home,&mdash;they talk little of it, but much of
Europe.</p>

<p>The United States is a theatre on which are met all
nations of Europe, each at present attached to the customs
they have left there, and agreeing [28] only in the
support of religious and political liberty: time alone can
wear down their heterogeneous habits into a national
character, which many other causes, besides those now
enumerated, may at present unite to oppose: the effect is
an evident want of energy, of heart and soul in every
thing animating to other nations. I am just returned
from witnessing the celebration of the anniversary of
their Liberty,&mdash;such a festival might well be expected to
call forth every spark of enthusiasm; but, even then, not
an eye either of spectators or actors glistened with joy
or animation, the latter seemed walking to a funeral; the
others contemplating the melancholy ceremony! Nothing
could dispel the illusion but the gay clothes of the female
spectators, to which their countenances in general bore a
strong contrast.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these unfavourable impressions however,
one could not but at intervals feel gratified;&mdash;it
was the assembly of a people to commemorate the epoch
of their liberty, and <i>we wished</i> to discover an elevation of
character deserving of the blessing, and to hail them as
brothers.</p>

<p><i>July 6th.</i> Took leave of New York, of which city,
perhaps I may have said more than necessary, so much
having been published before. By steam boat and land
carriage we were conveyed [29] to Bordentown, a beau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>tiful
elevated situation, commanding most extensive views,
where Joseph Buonaparte at present resides.<a name="FNanchor_8_62" id="FNanchor_8_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_62" class="fnanchor">8</a> He lives
quietly and hospitably, and, by accommodating himself
to the people, exists amongst them undisturbed:&mdash;on
his arrival he received a mark of attention as uncommon
as it was unexpected; a mob at Philadelphia collected to
see and welcome him; a compliment he mistook, for not
aware of their intention, and supposing it might be to
seize and deliver him up, he was with difficulty at length
prevailed upon to shew himself and receive their friendly
greetings. He is fond of shooting and finds plenty of
sport: in the widely spread low grounds covered with brush
wood, the Wood-cock and Snipe abound; and the Partridge
or Quail is plentiful in the high country. At a little
distance from Bordentown, on the edge of a precipitous
cliff, and surrounded by wood, forming a pleasing retreat,
stands his house.<a name="FNanchor_9_63" id="FNanchor_9_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_63" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>7th. Much pleased with the scenery during the passage
down the Delaware; on its beautiful Pensilvania side
many of the houses appeared to be placed in delightful
situations: as we floated [30] along the Sturgeon was seen
frequently darting upwards at the insects on the surface;
he is a fish but little valued here, either because his flavour
is not so good as it is with us, or perhaps a <i>royal</i> fish suits
not republican palates. The spot where Penn first
landed in search of a site for his intended city was pointed
out as we passed; and soon after came in view <span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>,
presenting by no means so favourable a coup d'&#339;il
as New York had done.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<h3>PHILADELPHIA</h3>

<p>Of this city I shall say little at present, but hasten the
western journey. Having both read and been told of
streets with clear water running along the channels, and
of trees planted on each side, affording a pleasing shade
during the heat of summer, I confess a great disappointment
at finding but very few trees, and no water but green
stinking puddles! Indeed, for the credit of New York,
I must say that their Board of Health is more active, or
the people themselves are more cleanly; for, there no stinks
assaulted our noses equal to those we met with here:
walking in these streets under the influence of a hot
burning sun I have [31] met with the putrifying carcass of
a dead dog; from the stench of which I have ran off, while
the natives were passing it without notice! We need not
then be at a loss to account for their fevers.</p>

<p>Away from the wharfs the streets are in general good,
well paved, and laid with fine broad causeways of brick:
the handsome flights of marble steps to the doors would
look still better if well polished; the marble is white with
blue veins, of a good kind, and comes by water about
sixty miles, at a cheap rate.</p>

<p>During the hot season, mineral waters, (chiefly soda,)
sometimes mixed with syrups, are drank in great abundance;&mdash;the
first thing every American who can afford
five cents (about threepence) takes, on rising in the morning,
is a glass of soda water: many houses are open for
the sale of it, and some of them are fitted up with Parisian
elegance.</p>

<p>Being so attached to water potations it is not surprising
that these people should stand in more than usual dread
of canine madness; they are dog-mad without being bit:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
such is the rage against the canine species that carts are
sent round the town both here and at New York every two
or three days, attended by fellows armed with bludgeons
and spears, with which they kill every dog they meet, and
receive I am informed a dollar for each. I had a fine
Bull-dog put an [32] end to in this manner, for which
fifty dollars had been offered since my arrival; the cold
blooded wretches first enticed him, as I heard, towards
them, and when he, not knowing fear, came up to be caressed,
they despatched him with spears and bludgeons.
For this I obtained no redress.</p>

<p>Accompanied Mr. ******* to the handsome public
library presented to Philadelphia by Dr. Franklin;<a name="FNanchor_10_64" id="FNanchor_10_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_64" class="fnanchor">10</a> and
of which his ungrateful countrymen make use, while they
are as silent as his statue over the entrance if the worthy
donor is mentioned, or if they do speak of him, it is generally
slightly;&mdash;the fact is, he was too good and too shrewd
for them to understand. I inquired respecting his philanthropic
bequest of money laid out at compound interest
in aid of young tradesmen, and heard it was properly
attended to; though my informer added that several who
had been assisted from the fund had not subsequently
been fortunate in trade: that is probably according to the
old adage "lightly come lightly go," they had spent it
instead of attending to business: the original sum was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
four thousand dollars, and it has now increased to sixteen
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_11_65" id="FNanchor_11_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_65" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

</div>


<p>14th. Visited the Penitentiary: this institution has
been so fully described by others that it is not necessary
to give more than an additional testimony to the truth of
its admirable [33] plan; unfortunately, the prison is at
this time so full, (five hundred are in confinement,) that
it is impossible to lock up, separately at night, those whose
crimes are trifling from culprits of greater magnitude;
but a new prison is building which will enable them,
when finished, to correct this evil: the utmost cleanliness
prevails, with order and industry; indeed, the whole had
the appearance of a well-regulated manufactory, in which
a regular debtor and creditor account is kept with each
individual, who receives, at the termination of his confinement,
the balance of his earnings, with which he may be
enabled to maintain himself while he seeks honest employment:
an excellent regulation. We afterwards viewed
the Hospital for Lunatics, where the same, or more attention
to cleanliness and every thing conducive to the health
and recovery of the patients pervade every part; no appearance
of gloom in the building, but all calculated to inspire
the mind with ease and comfort. There is a good garden
which, besides providing fruits and vegetables to the
house, affords a pleasant walk to the convalescent; and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
front of the building, encircled by a beautiful collection of
trees, lemon, orange, pomegranate, &amp;c., stands the statue
of William Penn, holding in his hand the Charter of Liberties.</p>

<p>This is not a cheap country for the <i>stranger</i>: [34] either
boarding-houses or taverns he must be in, (private lodgings
being unknown;) and in such establishments the
charges are high: but the <i>inhabitant</i> must, it would seem,
live at a very reasonable rate, as the following prices will
shew, and the lowest are not stated:&mdash;Meat, good at
six cents<a name="FNanchor_12_66" id="FNanchor_12_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_66" class="fnanchor">12</a> a lb., excellent Tea for one dollar a lb., Sugar
(loaf) for eleven cents a lb., Soap at ten or eleven cents a
lb., and other groceries cheap in proportion. Of Wines,
Port we buy for two dollars the gallon, Claret one and a
half the gallon, Sherry two and a half. Spirits,&mdash;good
Brandy for two dollars, Rum and Hollands the same.</p>

<p>But we will take leave of Philadelphia for the present&mdash;a
future opportunity may occur for further observations;
and to that chance we will leave it for the more important
view of the Western country.</p>

<p>21st. With a strong but light carriage, called here a
Dearborn waggon, for myself and party, and a light covered
baggage waggon driven by my servant, I left the City
about noon of such a day of heat as we had never until
lately experienced: in consequence of which my dog, the
fine animal above alluded to, ran off in a high fever, and
I [35] never saw him again; but he recovered, and came
back to the house I had left in search of me, and was
taken care of for a few days, when the dog butchers destroyed
him. Not to mention the breaking of a three
gallon Demijon bottle of good liquor in rattling over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the pavement, another cross adventure happened, which
made the commencement of so long a journey ominous;&mdash;having
sent the baggage waggon forward the first stage,
and there happening to be two roads and two inns with
the same sign at about the same distance, my man unluckily
took the wrong way&mdash;we slept the first night
therefore ignorant of what had happened to him; however
he crossed over, and to our mutual satisfaction joined
us the following day. On requesting the ostler to call me
early next morning, the drunken old beast told me I might
"call myself and be damned." Oh, the blessings of
independence!&mdash;But I will say this for the Americans,
that if during my stay one other oath was uttered it is
the most I heard.</p>

<p>24th. At Lancaster, Pensilvania.<a name="FNanchor_13_67" id="FNanchor_13_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_67" class="fnanchor">13</a> We left Philadelphia
on the 21st, and have travelled through a country
well cultivated and still improving as we advanced, until,
near this town, it breaks into hill and dale, woodland and
pasture, forming the most beautiful scenery, and wanting
nothing to the eye but water; actually [36] it is, we are
told, exceedingly well-watered. We admired the state of
cultivation, observing good crops of red clover-seed, and
the wheat stubbles clearly showing that heavy crops had
been carried;&mdash;the beautiful Indian corn just shooting
into ear, green and luxuriant, greatly relieved the eye;
the oats alone (not yet harvested) looked short in the straw
and bad, owing we were told to their quick ripening and
want of rain. The clumsy zig-zag rail fence of the first
settlers is giving way to strong post and rail, and in a few
spots to the live hedge, which looked beautiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/ew179.jpg" width="100%" alt="Bridge at Columbia, Pennsylvania" title=""  style="border: 0.15em solid" />
<span class="caption">Bridge at Columbia, Pennsylvania</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus we have passed along the centre of a fine valley of
cultivated land, grandly skirted by the primeval forest the
whole way; the houses and other buildings in general are
excellent, bespeaking the inhabitants to be at least rich
in comforts; which are after all true riches. The horses
of Pensilvania have been frequently praised: they are indeed
excellent; uniting strength of frame with activity,
and coming nearest in form to the old English charger
as seen in paintings; they are by no means generally castrated
as in England. The roads as yet we do not feel
inclined to praise, for they are abominably stony and jolting;
yet they seem to have been formed at some cost, in
some parts, I am told, at least twenty dollars [37] per rod;
but no carriage except of the strongest kind (and their
construction here is admirable for the purpose,) could
last long against the perpetual concussions they receive.
It is much to be regretted that in laying out the roads of
this new country, the space allotted for them had not been
thrice their present width, which would have left an ample
summer road on each side of the principal one, rendering
it better both for convenience and ornament; but in this
and too many more instances the Americans, instead of
adopting better plans, and improving by our errors, have
servilely copied those of the old country.</p>

<p>To the same lounging idleness remarked by Mr. Birkbeck
we too must bear testimony: added to which may
be observed a most unconciliating manner of studiously
avoiding common civility, arising we suppose from a vulgar
idea of shewing their independence. The black population
of all shades, from the deepest to nearly white, still
appears considerable as we proceed.</p>

<p>Lancaster is a very respectable town, with a handsome
court-house, &amp;c. Slaymaker's inn or tavern excellent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
A large manufactory of rifle barrels is carried on here,
much cheaper than they can be produced in Europe; a
very good rifle may be had complete for twelve or [38]
fourteen dollars, clumsy in appearance, but throwing a
ball with astonishing exactness. It was market day, and
horses, carriages, &amp;c., were among other things put up to
auction; the auctioneer, riding or driving up and down
the streets, with stentorian lungs proclaiming the qualities
of the horse or carriage on sale, and receiving the
biddings as he went on: a ranting preacher's exertions
are nothing compared with this man's.</p>

<p>29th. At Chambersburgh. From Lancaster, by Columbia
passing over the beautiful Susquehannah by a
close bridge of one mile and a quarter long, to this town
the roads are at present wretched, even dangerous; and the
settlers, German and Dutch boors, as abominable. Having
broke a buckle of one of the traces, we applied to a
blacksmith to mend it, which he refused to do. Night
with a thunder-storm approaching, we tied up the harness
as well as we could, wasting plenty of hearty bad wishes
upon the cursed smith which some poor Irishmen working
on the road joined us in, though they could not assist us;
and proceeded some distance, the storm still lowering, to
a tavern kept by one of the above wretches where we were
absolutely refused admittance: obliged to drive on we
just got to the door of another, when the thunder in tremendeous
peals burst over us [39] accompanied with torrents
of rain; here we bolted in determined to be received,
and found ourselves in the midst of parties of ill-looking
people drinking whiskey and smoking. It was the bar or
tap-room, and as no offer was made of a better or safer
place for ourselves and luggage, and a little disapprobation
being consequently shewn by some of my party, the brute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
landlord, notwithstanding the storm, told us we had better
drive on to the next town, if we disliked his accommodations.&mdash;Not
chusing to be drenched in rain for his ill
humour we were obliged to remain during pleasure;
until at length I got mine host into better humour, and he
gave us a tolerable good supper and beds, though with the
usual company of bugs and fleas, and without water for
washing, which they positively refused to let us have; observing,
we might wash out of doors. This man boasted
of being possessed of thirty-five thousand dollars in property,
and said, that land now worth one hundred dollars
per acre was bought by his father for four dollars.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Tired of such abominable inns and the keepers of them,
we have now twice boiled the kettle in the woods and
breakfasted upon the contents [40] of our canteen, a plan
we have much enjoyed, and recommend to all travellers
in this country whose convenience it may suit. The
scenery is beautiful, the land pretty well cultivated and
finely interspersed with woodland; the harvest, except
Indian corn or maize, is nearly got in, and seems to have
been abundant. Man alone here stands an object of disgust.
How strangely to our circumscribed views does
Providence work its purposes! To a rough untutored
set of naked savages, another race of little less than savages
(clothed savages) has succeeded; who, in all probability,
will in their turn give place to a third of some intellect
and refinement; themselves driven from their paternal
hearths by the insolence of an aristocracy, the intolerance
of a state religion, or the craving demands of an
extravagant government: these, seeking for themselves
and their posterity relief from such evils, will bring into
this fine portion of the earth, the letters and refined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
manners, which alone it wants to make it perhaps one of
the most desirable countries of the globe.</p>

<p>We are now ascending the first range of mountains separating
the eastern from the western part of the continent.
The grand and ancient monarchs of the forest have only
been removed where the road is opened for the passage
of the [41] traveller. The Oak, the Chestnut, the Locust
and various other trees tower aloft in their prime, while
some lie fallen with age, and others, inclining from their
aged roots, ready to follow,&mdash;emblems these of the lot of
humanity!</p>

<p>The heat of the sun, though great, is here tempered by
a cool air from the mountains. A man, his wife, and children
travelling in their light waggon with one horse,
have joined us; they are on their way to Virginia, in which
State he lives; he seems to be a good-natured civil being
and by no means wanting in humanity in general; yet
custom could make him smile at my expression of abhorrence,
when he said there was no law practically for slaves
in that State, and that he has <i>frequently</i> seen them <i>flogged
to death</i>!</p>

</div>


<h3>A PENSILVANIAN INNKEEPER</h3>

<p>When we drove up to the door, a black or two came to
the horses, no master or his representative appeared.
We got out and walked into the common entry, and at
length I accosted a stranger to know if there was a master
of the house, who very civilly said he was in the back
part and would perhaps soon come; I then went and called
the Independent, who came forward, [42] I told him we
wanted breakfast, he just inquired for how many, and
then, without shewing a place to sit down, went to order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
it. This man I afterwards could perceive knew what he
was about,&mdash;the above is one of the modes of shewing to
an Englishman their boasted liberty and independence;
their vulgar minds cannot perceive the difference between
servility and civility. Having a tent in the baggage
waggon and every thing for the purpose, we last night
escaped these sort of fellows, and their bugs and fleas,
by driving into the wood, where, finding a pleasant spot
and good water, we lighted a fire, took tea very comfortably,
and slept well upon the camp-bedsteads: this, during
the hot weather, is by far the most pleasant plan where
it can be adopted; but there are some objections to it
which cannot easily be got over; it is not always in one's
power to pitch the tent in the neighbourhood of good
water; the apprehension of the horses breaking their halters
and straying is not pleasant; (otherwise, they are quite
as well off as ourselves away from American buildings;)
and the greater attendance necessarily required from our
own servants, both to ourselves and horses is harassing,&mdash;another
assistant or two would have rendered the plan
feasible with comfort and less expence. By the way, it
is strange that [43] tavern-keeping should increase in
these times, so dead as they say to trade, and consequently
one would suppose also dead for travelling; but
so it is, taverns are every where building or adding to:
what a joyous prospect for the bugs and fleas! Expressing
myself at a loss the other day to account for the number
of public-houses building, a black man within hearing
said he guessed they were preparing for better times&mdash;they
could just now do it cheaper as hands, in consequence
of want of money, were more plentiful: his observation
appears just.</p>

<p><i>August 3d.</i> The weather is extremely hot, and we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
encountered several most tremendous storms of thunder
and lightning. The thermometer is now at 88&deg; in the
shade with a draught of air at one o'clock; in the sun it is
at least 108&deg;. Many parties from various nations and of
different modes of travelling are on the road for the West,
and we hear of great numbers having passed during the
spring and summer, all making towards the great point
of attraction the western country.</p>

<p>We have now passed over Cove mountain and Scrubridge;<a name="FNanchor_14_68" id="FNanchor_14_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_68" class="fnanchor">14</a>
the road over both has been lately formed, is
judiciously laid, and would be excellent were the stones
covered with gravel, or rather were they broken small;
as it is, one is shaken to pieces without the possibility of
avoiding it. [44] Under this evil we are solaced by the
views of grand forest scenery,&mdash;the Oak of several kinds,
the sweet Chestnut, the black Walnut and Hickory, with
here and there tracts of pine, cover these mountains;
affording shelter to herds of deer, foxes, rakoons, and also,
as we had occular proof, to snakes of various kinds.
Throughout the mountains and their neighbourhood you
almost universally meet with most excellent water, affording
a delicious beverage during the hot weather; the trunk
of a tree hollowed out is set up like a pump, with a spout
near the top, from which the water, constantly rising
towards its level, runs in a clear and cool stream.</p>

<span class="caption">View on Scrub Ridge</span>
</div>

<p>5th. At Bloody Run, called so from a battle fought
with the natives;<a name="FNanchor_15_69" id="FNanchor_15_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_69" class="fnanchor">15</a> here stands a little town pleasantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
situate on the Juniatta river, and containing several useful
trades, such as blacksmith, wheelwright, harness-maker,
tailor, and draper, &amp;c. We approached it for the
last nine miles by a new and excellent road just finishing,
which is laid a considerable way along the Juniatta, the
banks of which are beautifully edged with woodland.
Some alterations and repairs done to the dearborn and the
waggon here were charged at the following rate:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>
<p>We here enjoyed ourselves under the comforts of a good
inn and attentive landlady.</p>

<p>10th. At Johnson's tavern, foot of Chestnut Ridge.
We have now passed the Allegany mountains, and can
affirm that at this time of the year there is little except
the stony road very formidable to encounter: the line of
it is laid with judgment, and with steady horses and a
stout carriage may well be passed over by those who fear
not a shaking; that, indeed, they may rely upon. The
settlers on the eastern side of the mountains take great
pains to deter the traveller from attempting the pass, and
even after having surmounted the Cove mountain, Scrubridge,
&amp;c., I was told of the great difficulties of Laurel
Hill; the fact is, it proved the easiest of the whole; nothing
annoyed us but the sun, it being about mid-day when we
began the ascent.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the expense of travelling in this
country, I give therefore a night's bill at one of the better
houses, viz.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>A night's bill at a good English inn for the same would
be double the amount.</p>


<h3>AMERICAN WAITERS</h3>

<p>A tavern-keeper brought in some wine glasses stinking
of whiskey, to which a cloth seemed never to have been
applied; out of a pitcher of water he poured some into a
glass, just shook it, and then throwing the water into the
waiter upon which the wine stood, walked away satisfied
with this proof of his cleanliness: and a female the other
evening, in order to brush away the flies while we were at
supper, flourished over our heads her dirty pocket handkerchief,
in the absence of the brush of feathers fixed upon
a long stick, which is generally waved over the dishes
during the repast. The practice of going barefoot is here
very general among working people, particularly the
females; it is by no means an uncommon sight [47] in
New York and Philadelphia, during the summer season,
even in good houses; a custom this, probably, at least as
cleanly as that of wearing close shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>12th. At Greensburgh, thirty miles east from Pittsburgh.
The country we have lately passed is beautifully
undulated, land of good quality interspersed with woodland,
worth near from twenty to twenty-five dollars per
acre; water plentiful and good.</p>

<p>Our landlord has just returned from a journey to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
western country as far as St. Louis, on the borders of the
Missourie territory; his report of the country is not favourable:
he says it is very unhealthy, which he ascribes to
the woodland, contrary to the general situation of such
land, being lower than the open prairie; consequently retaining
much stagnant water, the fruitful cause of diseases.</p>

<p>18th. At Hayes' tavern, three miles west of Pittsburgh,
in which "Birmingham of America" I had intended to
make some stay; but the heat, dirt, filth, and charges
made me hasten out of it in search of rest and fresh air to
this place.</p>

<p>The town of Pittsburgh<a name="FNanchor_16_70" id="FNanchor_16_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_70" class="fnanchor">16</a> stands beautifully, at the
junction of the two rivers, and the land around it is of
good quality; but its trade is upon the wane, not alone
owing I apprehend to the times, [48] but to the town of
Wheeling's being better situated for ready communication
with the western country, and consequently thriving
upon its decay. Pittsburgh has, too, suffered greatly
from the extensive failures of the country banks. I met
everywhere grave, eager, hungry looking faces; and could
perceive, as well as hear complaints of, a general want of
employment.</p>

<p>It being near the hour of dinner when we arrived, we
joined the company at table, consisting chiefly of constant
boarders, who, after a quick and silent repast, vanished;
leaving at table two pleasant and travelled men, one a
man of law from Boston, (Massachusetts,) the other a
gentleman resident in Virginia. We talked of slavery,
which the latter defended ingeniously, though not convincingly,
by quotations from the sacred writings, St.
Paul, &amp;c.;&mdash;he owned a numerous establishment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
slaves, and such was his reliance upon their attachment
and content, that he had not the slightest apprehension of
danger to his family during his absence: he had come to
Pittsburgh to attend a trial, and entertained us with an
account of the conduct in court of his Counsel, who, he
gave us to understand, was a man high in the profession;
neither Counsel nor Judge as is well known, put on here
any gown but the heat of the day had induced this gentleman's
[49] Counsel first to put off his coat, and not finding
himself yet cool enough he got rid of waistcoat also; and
then, further to cool his constitution and assist thought, he
put a cigar into his mouth, and in this trim paraded up
and down the court. The old gentleman, who had been
in most parts of Europe, then asked what could strangers,
just coming from England, think of such conduct in a court
of trial? The glass circulated and in such conversation
the time passed agreeably, until, at some general observation
I made, the Bostonian fired up and we were as near
a quarrel as any prudent people need to be; when the
Virginian interposed and succeeded in making peace:
however, harmony had been broken and we soon after
separated. In the evening, expecting a pleasant drive of
three miles, we left Pittsburgh; and, crossing the river by
a respectable new-covered-bridge, for which I paid a toll
of one dollar each carriage, took a wrong turn on the other
side; and after encountering most dreadful roads, and
making a tour of above six or eight miles instead of three,
arrived by moonlight at the long-looked-for tavern.</p>

<p>At this obscure inn exists yet hearty at the age of eighty-eight
years, one of fortune's fools, Captain Fowler, an
Englishman late of the 38th regiment of foot; a man who
in early life was [50] advanced, solely by merit and strict
attention to the duties of a soldier, through every gradation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
until he not only bore a captain's commission, but at the
same time received the pay of adjutant and paymaster to
three regiments.&mdash;Having attained to this rank, the
favourite of Lord Percy, General Crosby and other officers
of his day, and being in the high road to further honour and
promotion, he was induced on the insidious misrepresentations
of a sordid brother, to quit all these favours of
fortune and come to America: here, at the instance of this
relative embarking in one plausible speculation or another,
he wasted his fortune; and now wears out the remainder
of his days unknown at this tavern, kept by a
good-hearted rough Irishman who has become his son-in-law.
It is pleasing to see the attention that he receives
from the family, which uniting with age and religion seem
effectually to reconcile the old man to his fate.</p>


<h3>SERVANTS</h3>

<p>At this small house are maintained four female and two
male servants, yet the house is not half cleaned, and the
garden is little else but weeds; litter and dirt pervade
the premises, while these Independents will play for hours
at ball, or loll [51] over a rail to rest themselves. Behold
a true picture-general! How <i>pleasing</i> to the lover of
freedom to contemplate its blessed effects! Leisure, instead
of inducing habits of mental improvement, and
cleanliness, leaves them, in utter negligence of both, only
to pass half their time in mere idleness and dirt: but why
do I speak of the lower order while those, who should set
these a better example, pass their days at taverns and
other boarding-houses in idle games of shuffleboard and
ninepins; or, seated for hours motionless under the shed
which is universally attached to the houses, seem to exist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
solely to inhale the fumes of tobacco. Truly these people
understand not liberty,&mdash;civilly, it is idleness and licentiousness;
religiously, a leaving them to their wildest
fancies.</p>


<h3>BLACK POPULATION IN FREE PENSILVANIA</h3>

<p>A black girl with youthful spirits was playing with a lad
in the town street, when the wheelwright, with whom I
was talking while he mended the carriage, said, "if it
were not for fear of the [52] law one would be inclined to
put an end to that black&mdash;&mdash;; they ought to be taught the
difference between a black and a white, and to pay more
respect than to think of associating with them!"&mdash;The
man spoke really in earnest, and would have thought
little of putting the girl to death.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards I met a white little boy who
followed a tall mulatto woman, and with all his little
strength was beating her with a stick; at length the woman
could bear it no longer, and told him, if she should be
<i>whipped</i> the next moment for it, she would pull his ears
if he continued to do so. The same day, in my hearing
a mulatto woman was threatened by her master with the
application of the "cowhide" for not bringing the Independent
his umbrella quick enough!</p>


<h3>NIGHT</h3>

<p>From the slight chirping of a few grasshoppers or crickets
in England, no one can have a conception of the noise
of a summer night here; all the insect tribe seem to open
at once and to join in one perpetual chorus, very unpleasant
to ears unaccustomed to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>


<h3>[53] AMERICANS AND SCOTS</h3>

<p>The Pensilvanians resemble in many points the Scots:
they go barefoot, they have both some dirty habits, neither
have yet very generally erected temples to Cloacina beyond
the immediate neighbourhood of great towns. A
medical man lately told me that the itch, a disorder
which proves uncleanliness where it prevails, was as
rife as in Scotland; of drams of whisky and bitters
they are equally fond. In cookery the comparison
turns in favour of our northern neighbours, who understand
it far better than they do here, where it is the
most abominable messing and spoiling of provision
imaginable: nothing but frying in butter till the stomach
turns even at the smell; of vegetables they have but
small variety, and of these the sickly tasting beet is
a favourite, which they dress in the same disgusting way
as the flesh-meat, neither good for palate or stomach.</p>

<p>22d. At Washington, Pensilvania, eight miles west of
Canonsburgh: this latter little town stands in a healthy
beautiful situation. It has a college in an unfinished
state; there are three professorships, viz. Mathematics
and Natural Philosophy, Languages, and Humanity Class,
the whole supported [54] by voluntary contributions to
which the government have made a handsome addition:
at this time there are ninety students.<a name="FNanchor_17_71" id="FNanchor_17_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_71" class="fnanchor">17</a> The land about
Canonsburgh to this place, is generally of very good
quality, and just now may be bought at a reasonable rate;
its nominal value, I was informed by one of the students,
is from under twenty, to the best about thirty dollars per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
acre; it abounds in coal, lime, and iron; the first only two
cents per bushel at the pit, and laid down at the door for
two more. There are many English settlers hereabout,
and the shew of improved management was very perceptible.
There are some objections however to this part of
the country, which perhaps the improvement of roads
and canals will in time obviate; it is a distant point from
both the great markets for commodities, the Eastern and
Western; consequently what they sell is low, and that
which they buy is very high.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Washington (Pensilvania,) is a very pleasant, fast-increasing,
and of course thriving town, through which
the great national western road and six others are laid.
The College here too is in an unfinished state; it has now
only [55] forty-five students, owing to the dismissal of a
favourite president, and the appointment of one not liked.<a name="FNanchor_18_72" id="FNanchor_18_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_72" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>


<h3>VIRGINIA</h3>

<p>On leaving Washington a few miles, the traveller enters
the state of Virginia, which he crosses to Wheeling, a town
on the eastern bank of the Ohio. The whole way is in
general a fine drive, and in two or three years will be better
from the improved roads forming every where as we pass
with great judgment and spirit. The National road is a
work truly worthy of a great nation, both in its idea and
construction; upon it, the traveller will be enabled to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
with comfort, from the eastern coast, westward the whole
way to New Orleans; and perhaps by another branch to
St. Louis, without being stopt to pay a single toll.<a name="FNanchor_19_73" id="FNanchor_19_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_73" class="fnanchor">19</a> This
is as it should be; for roads are one of those important
works which are scarcely ever executed well by individuals,
and which therefore should be done by their representatives,
and paid for by the treasury; one is not then stopt
every five or ten miles to pay a toll frequently exorbitant;
nor would the public be speculated upon [56] by individual
proprietors<a name="FNanchor_20_74" id="FNanchor_20_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_74" class="fnanchor">20</a> or small companies, who seldom execute
these works upon a scale sufficiently liberal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/ew203.jpg" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Almost all the labourers employed here upon the roads
are either Irish or English, and it is not certain that these
republicans have not a secret pride in beholding the natives
of the old world toiling for their benefit; however, the
earnings of the men are I believe sufficient to render them
in time independent, and I must say they look in general
well fed, well clothed and comfortable. We passed one
party employed in ploughing down part of the uneven
road with a strong machine drawn by eight oxen, while two
others drew a large wooden scoop
to shovel up and lead away the
ploughed up soil: it appeared to save much labour.
The Irish here have not lost in our esteem; two or
three times we have been beholden to individuals of
that nation for good-natured little services: one of them
lately aided me successfully to get along part of the new
road where we had met with some opposition; another
actually accompanied us about nine miles on a like occa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>sion,
not with a view to remuneration, for I could not
persuade him to [57] take any thing for his services but
some refreshment at the tavern. I heartily return them
the good wishes they so frequently expressed as we passed
them. One of the above men had acquired some property;
he told me that seven years ago he bought land at
six dollars per acre, and that he had just sold a part of it
at fifty, and some even so high as seventy dollars per acre.
The proximity of the new road had increased thus the
value of his land.</p>

<p>The beautiful Sassafras shrub is now plentiful, also
several others which I in vain endeavoured to obtain the
name of; for the people seem almost totally ignorant of
the trees and shrubs in their woods.</p>


<h3>WHEELING</h3>

<p>Is very pleasantly situated on the Ohio, and, standing
upon high ground, appears to be healthy; it is also a very
thriving town, as a number of excellent buildings and
others rapidly carrying up sufficiently testify; among these
is a public seminary endowed by a professional man in
the law, who, dying without heirs, left amply sufficient to
endow it:<a name="FNanchor_21_75" id="FNanchor_21_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_75" class="fnanchor">21</a> near to this stands a neat chapel erected by
methodists. Two good vineyards [58] are planted here,
which looked thriving and, we were told, produce excellent
wine.</p>

<p>Without meaning to speak in favour of slavery, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
yet state the fact that, during the drive across this small
arm of the slave state of Virginia, the white people seemed
far more respectable and civilized than in the free state
we had just left; almost all we met accosted us pleasantly,
as if to welcome a stranger without that rude stare to
which we had become accustomed; the blacks, too, appeared
to be well clothed, civilized, and comfortable; very
superior to the free black population elsewhere seen. We
had scarcely crossed the Ohio into the free state of that
name, when we found a rogue and rudeness; freedom
must at least take honesty for her companion or she is
not worth a rush.</p>


<h3>STATE OF OHIO</h3>

<p>On entering the state of Ohio by this route we find little
to interest; a wild uncleared hilly country,<a name="FNanchor_22_76" id="FNanchor_22_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_76" class="fnanchor">22</a> which with
little alteration continues [59] till you approach St. Clairsville:
the soil then is clay; the town well placed and its
buildings good and neat; land hereabouts, a good grazing
soil, is worth about twenty dollars per acre. We bought
here, out of a waggon load, half a peck of peaches for six
cents, (3d.) the peach and apple orchards are literally
breaking down with fruit; every morning we stop at the
first orchard to take in as many apples as we want for the
day.</p>

<p>My man experienced an accident, in coming down one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of these steep hills, which might have proved worse in its
consequence than it did; not seeing him behind as usual
I waited sometime for his coming up, and began to feel
uneasy about him, when we heard his waggon wheels
approaching: one of the horses had broke the hame-strap,
which, throwing the pole on one side, had precipitated the
waggon and driver into some brush-wood on the road side;&mdash;while
in this situation, unable to extricate himself, a
country waggon luckily came past, and he applied to the
fellows with it for aid, which the human brutes refused
without <i>first</i> being paid for their trouble.&mdash;From such
contemplations let us turn for relief to the variety of foliage
so highly pleasing in this part of the wilderness; we now
see the Tulip tree for the first time; the Sassafras grows
thickly, and a great variety of other plants and shrubs of
which, [60] for want of botanical knowledge, I know not
the names.</p>

<p>Several people clothed something like Jews with long
beards have passed us at different times on horseback;
these, I was told, are a Christian sect of charitable pilgrims
styling themselves Dunkards.<a name="FNanchor_23_77" id="FNanchor_23_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_77" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>30th. The weather has been for some days past cooler
owing to the falling of some rain, but is again becoming
warm. The sudden and violent changes of temperature
are at least as frequent on this side of the mountains as
on the eastern shores, whatever may have been asserted
to the contrary, and rain is almost always succeeded by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cold. On the 24th of August in the early morning the
thermometer of Fahrenheit was at 46&deg;, it has since been
above 80&ordm;, but again this morning has sunk to 56&deg;.</p>

<p>31st. The road is covered with dust arising from the
great number of horses, waggons, &amp;c. conveying people
from a methodist camp-meeting just held in the neighbourhood,
at which it was calculated that nearly four
thousand attended; the convocation had continued for
several days, during which these people had slept upon
the ground in the intervals between praying and
preaching.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 2d. At Chillicothe,<a name="FNanchor_24_78" id="FNanchor_24_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_78" class="fnanchor">24</a> Ohio. Watson's [61]
hotel; the wit's mode of spelling it (Hothell) is more
significant, for the beds swarm with bugs, and the thermometer
is at 86&deg; in the shade. I called at the land office
and was shewn the map of the district; most of the sections,
except those south-east of the town, (a poor mountainous
tract,) are entered, and to my surprize, in general paid for;
so this considerable part of the state is in the hands of
land speculators, under whose baneful influence a chief
part of the country remains a wilderness, which otherwise
would have been under cultivation, if open to real settlers
at the government price per acre. The British government
have in Canada acted more wisely, in offering the lands
only to those who will build, clear, and settle upon
them.</p>

<p>5th. At Col. Woods' Log tavern, nine miles east of the
town of West Union, Ohio. The road has lately led us
through a fine fertile tract of vale, beautifully skirted by
the high rocky woodland, from whence is quarried a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
hard granite for building and other purposes. The town
in this tract called Bainbridge is a new settlement,<a name="FNanchor_25_79" id="FNanchor_25_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_79" class="fnanchor">25</a> but
already possesses some neat and good houses; the value
of land of the district may be estimated by the price of
town lots, containing sufficient space for a house and garden,
which are as high in best situations as two hundred
dollars (forty-five [62] pounds;)&mdash;the out-field lots are
from twenty to twenty-five dollars per acre. This tract
throughout appears well watered; the only objection I
heard of to it, and that perhaps no small one to a settler,
is, there being many disputed titles.</p>

<p>Among the growth in the wood we have lately noticed
the <i>Papaw</i>, a bushy elegant shrub with large leaves; its
fruit not yet ripe. The Tulip tree becomes more common,
also more Elm and Beech, Sycamore and Buttonwood;
all these are found here of immense size, towering high in
air with stems perfectly straight. Near to Chillicothe,
which is in north latitude about 39&deg; 15&acute;, we saw the first
tobacco cultivation; it looked well notwithstanding the
drought which now begins to be felt every where.</p>

<p>Upon admiring a large strong dog the other day, his
owner told me he was very necessary on account of the
wolves which are yet numerous: the dogs here are as mixed
a breed as the people, and a thorough-bred is not to be
seen. Deer are plentiful, also rackoons and squirrels;
the wild Turkey we saw yesterday, which seemed to resemble
exactly our dark tame breed.</p>

<span class="caption">Ferry at Maysville, on the Ohio</span>
</div>

<p>5th. Several parties on horseback have passed us on
the road, making inquiries of the way to a methodist
<i>preachment</i>, and to judge from the [63] immense numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
that collect on these occasions fanaticism seems to have
taken deep root here.</p>

<p>6th. Started with my host on an expedition through
the woods to visit a farm belonging to him. We took our
guns uselessly for we saw no game of any kind, but, on
arriving at the farm, got some good peaches and drank the
pure water of a fine spring; being warm, he directed me
to let the water run upon my wrists for some time before
drinking, to prevent the effects of suddenly taking cold
water while heated; these sort of cautions have probably
been handed down from the native hunters. We passed
a kind of vine which has a poisonous quality,<a name="FNanchor_26_80" id="FNanchor_26_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_80" class="fnanchor">26</a> the leaves
being rubbed on the skin will raise irritating blisters.
The Poplar tree, my host observed, made better shingles
for covering roofs, if painted, than the Cedar, which is
commonly used unpainted; perhaps any of the poplar
tribe may do, and where a light covering is required
might be advantageously employed in England.</p>

<p>A large party of settlers from the state of Illinois came
by, they are returning to that of New York, to the same
spot they quitted a year and a half ago. The account
they give is that a fine fertile tract of land about forty
miles from the river Illinois, and not far from its confluence
with the Mississipi, was purchased by them, and
they [64] settled upon it last summer; since which period
they had lost eight of their party by dysentery, fever and
ague, and that the remainder had determined to quit the
purchase, and return with the loss of all their time and
nearly all their money. These are facts much lessening
our sanguine expectations as to the western paradise;
however, I am resolved to proceed and endeavour to
ascertain the truth on all the points for which I undertook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the journey. One of the above party told me, that when
ill he had paid a fee of twenty-five dollars for one visit of a
Physician, the distance being about twenty miles; if this
be true the medical science at least must meet with sufficient
encouragement.<a name="FNanchor_27_81" id="FNanchor_27_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_81" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The state of Ohio took a rough leave of us down a
rocky precipitous hill, at the foot of which we found ourselves
safe on the bank of the river; and driving down to
the water's edge into a <i>team-boat</i> lately established, were,
about dark landed on the other side, and comfortably received
at a good family inn at Maysville kept by Mr.
Chambers, a sensible clever man, who came to it from
Jersey State about seventeen years ago, and [65] who has,
by judgment in the purchase of land &amp;c., made a good
fortune for himself and family: some lots about the town,
which he bought for four hundred dollars six years since,
are now worth some thousands; such is the rapid increase
in the value of property in this country when a man makes
a <i>good hit</i>.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>On quitting this State, through which we have travelled
from Wheeling in a south-west direction to Maysville or
Limestone, (Kentucky,) the impression it has made is
not so favourable as I had been led to expect; though our
course comprehended but a small part of it, yet we passed
through the most populous districts, if we except that
around Cincinnati. Instead of a garden, I found a wilderness;
land speculators have got a considerable part in their
baleful clutches to make their market on the wants of the
poor settler; but I am apt to think have been themselves
outwitted, owing to the superior attraction of the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
distant western country: yet is Ohio a desirable one, as
it contains within itself most articles of the first necessity
and perhaps more; coals in abundance, lime, stone for
building, iron and other metals, with fine rivers for transporting
commodities of all kinds. The face of [66] that
part which I saw, is exceedingly hilly, in some places
approaching to mountains; but the soil in general well
adapted to grazing, and the whole strongly resembling
our county of Derby upon a gigantic scale. The northwest
part of the State, an immense tract of country, has
been lately ceded by the natives to the United States,<a name="FNanchor_28_82" id="FNanchor_28_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_82" class="fnanchor">28</a>
and I believe has been surveyed, allotted, and is now
offering to the public at one and a quarter dollar per acre
ready money: of its fertility much is reported, and its
communication with Lake Erie, and by it with the other
lakes and the eastern markets, will render it perhaps more
desirable than the part we have travelled over.</p>

<p>The roads at present are altogether in a state of nature,
the trees only just chopped off about a foot from the
ground, and rocks, and stones, and gullies left to be got
over as we can; no wonder then, that you see a blacksmith's
shop every two or three miles, and tavern by the side of it
to put up and spend your money while the repairs are
doing; for which, however trifling, Vulcan cannot form his
mouth to any word less than a dollar, and his friend the
tavern-keeper charges an "<i>elevenpenny bit</i>" if you have
but two cents <i>worth</i> of whisky.</p>

<p>As to the general want of cleanliness in the [67] taverns,
of which so much has been said <i>and so justly</i>, though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
keepers of them have no doubt a large share of the blame,
yet much may be said in their defence; the fact is, their
customers are of so filthy habits that to have a house clean
is almost impossible; and though bugs swarm it is true
in the bed-rooms, beyond an English imagination, it is
extremely difficult in this warm climate to keep free from
them, particularly at inns, as they are constantly carried
in the cloaths, luggage, &amp;c., from one house to another
until many a bug, it may happen, has been as great a
traveller as Mr. Birkbeck himself. Yet do the people
deserve reprehension, for while "such things are," and
sundry other unseemly appearances are constantly, in
their bed-rooms and other parts, existing in full force;
while their gardens (ill deserving the name) are over-run
with weeds, and cropped in the most slovenly manner;
while a thousand disagreeables are around them, these&mdash;what
shall I call them?&mdash;slaves to sloth, and worshippers
of an idle deity of independence, will sit lounging against
the wall with arms across smoking cigars; or you shall see
the female part, lolling out of their windows gazing at
nothingness.</p>

<h3>[68] KENTUCKY<br />
MAYSVILLE, OR LIMESTONE</h3>

<p>Here at Mr. Chamber's, we staid two days, received
more like guests than as travellers at an inn; his conversation
was amusing and his anecdotes conveying much information:
in his garden which is spacious and well-managed,
we ate the first ripe grapes we had met with.
The town, which seems to be fast increasing in size and
importance, stands high from the level of the river, and
is screened by towering hills, affording in the immediate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
neighbourhood and also up the river situations for building
that few places can surpass: the view from above the
town looking down the river is beautiful and extensive;
a considerable part of the buildings are of brick; glass
works are established, and other manufactories requiring
machinery. All these advantages however will hardly
compensate with most people for its being within the
territories of a slave state. Of the determined obstinacy
and turpitude of a black boy we were here witnesses; a
silver fruit-knife had been left upon the table, and he had
secreted it, the knife was soon missed, and search made
for it in vain; at length, suspicion falling upon him, he
was sent for and [69] questioned, but denied all knowledge
of the knife with an air of the greatest innocency; he was
offered half a dollar and to be screened from punishment
if he would give it up, but continued to deny that he had
taken it, wishing, "his flesh might rot if he had"&mdash;his
pockets were at length examined; and the knife and an
apple dropt together from one of them, upon which the
young rogue declared that the person who searched him
had put it there, and a terrible beating which I fear he got,
did not in the least make him prevaricate.</p>

<p>We took leave of our host and hostess not without some
regret, and, as we slowly paced up the long hill which
rises immediately from the town, looked back frequently
to view the beautiful river scenery from the different
points it offered: a turn at the top suddenly presented on
all sides a cleared, well cultivated, and inclosed country;
the road was good, the day beautiful, and we bowled
along through plentiful crops of Indian corn, rejoicing
that we had escaped the wilderness, and thinking we had
really entered upon the garden of the United States.
After a few miles of good road however these pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
ideas were shaken out by an absolute rock, upon which
with but little intermission we rattled for near twenty
miles, passing through a place called Blue Licks.<a name="FNanchor_29_83" id="FNanchor_29_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_83" class="fnanchor">29</a> At
its salt springs [70] the deer and buffaloe used formerly
to be found in immense herds; it is now a watering place,
the resort of invalids: yet let not the English reader here
picture to himself either Bath, Cheltenham, or Tunbridge
Wells, but a few dispersed log huts and two taverns of the
same description. Many of the men here wear, instead
of a coat, a short cloak, a little resembling that part of the
old English dress, which if they knew how to carry with
any grace would look well.</p>

<p>The drought is now exceedingly great, and we have
reports of much stock dying to the south of this state for
want of water; we therefore see the country at as unfavourable
a time as possible; yet, under these disadvantages, the
grass is really green, a circumstance which proves the
strong natural fertility of the soil, also shewn by the spontaneous
growth of the white clover among the trees of the
uncleared forest land where it has been grazed. Of this
grazed forest the farmers assert that it will not, when
cleared, broke up and sown, produce so much corn by
one third per acre as that which has not been grazed, and
many of them consequently shut up their forest land from
all cattle and even from pigs.</p>


<h3>[71] AN ODD MISTAKE</h3>

<p>A little black boy was playing upon the ground, at the
tavern-door with a dog; I pointed to them and said to the
landlord, (a very civilized man,) "Do you make christians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of these?" "Oh no."&mdash;"You name them without the
clergyman?" "Oh yes; we sometimes give them one
name and then alter it for another:"&mdash;"And does not your
church find fault with you sometimes for such neglect?"</p>

<p>"No, they never think of such things."</p>

<p>"And when they die you throw them into the ground
without further ceremony?"</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>,&mdash;Always let them lie just where it happens&mdash;I
suppose, you do not do so in your country; do you?</p>

<p><i>Self</i>,&mdash;Certainly not; we think very differently upon
the subject; that child would there be free, the moment
it set foot upon our shores.</p>

<p><i>Landlord</i>,&mdash;"Oh, you mean the <i>negre</i>; I thought you
were speaking of the dog all the time. Yes; we christen
<i>them</i>; but we do not let them eat with us, only the Quakers
let them eat with them!"</p>

<p>This man's kitchen presented a picture which is general
with some exceptions throughout the [72] slave country,
a description of it will therefore serve for all the rest.
Behold, a dark log building with a floor of mud, upon which
a number of little black children are at all times to be seen
crawling, while others are perhaps lying without the door
sunning themselves; all mostly without any covering whatever:
these are the progeny of the cook and other slaves,
and are destined for sale or to supply the places of others.
A quick lively little black girl, of about nine years of age,
waited here with such spirit and so cleverly upon the
guests that she attracted our notice; and upon praising
her dexterity to her master he told us, that he had more
than once refused three hundred dollars which had been
offered for her.&mdash;The kitchen, besides being made the
daily black-nursery, is also their general dormitory: at
night, they creep round the warm embers and huddled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
together sleep in the contaminated atmosphere of this
Augean stable, in the midst of the dirt and abominations
of which the traveller's meat is prepared, and served more
decently than might be expected; after escaping (<i>perhaps</i>)
the fingers of the poor little creatures, who, watching their
opportunity, rise from under the dressers, pilfer the meat
and dip their fingers in gravies.</p>

<p>The ovens are, very conveniently for this warm [73]
climate, built apart from the house in the open air. Mine
host, notwithstanding the above mistake, was a man of
very respectable manners, and his wife, a lady-like
woman, presided at the supper which was even elegantly
set out to a company most heterogeneous. Opposite to
me, a young fellow seated himself, without his coat and
in his dirty shirt sleeves of at least seven days' wear, and,
not shewing the least of that shyness which such a man
would experience in England, played away with his knife
and fork perfectly at his ease: indeed, the clumsy gait and
bent body of our peasant is hardly ever seen here, every one
walks erect and easy; a plainness of dress and coarseness
of the texture amounting to vulgarity, blunt discourse,
in short, the manners of the herd, are <i>affected</i> by the few,
and all mix without any seeming distinction. To have
objected to the company of the dirty fellow just mentioned
would have probably ended in a "<i>rough and tumble</i>,"
and the loss of an eye, as it is not an uncommon accomplishment
to be a good hand at "<i>gouging</i>." This brings
to mind a story of a fellow who had been so terribly mauled
at a "rough and tumble" that a man, compassionating
his condition, said, "you have come off badly this time I
doubt?" "Have I," says he; triumphantly shewing
from his pocket [74] at the same time an eye, which he had
extracted during the combat, and preserved for a trophy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>


<h3>LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY<a name="FNanchor_30_84" id="FNanchor_30_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_84" class="fnanchor">30</a></h3>

<p>The approach to this town is for several miles along
good road, and through a country much improving in
natural advantages and cultivation. Lexington has been
often enough described; thirty-five years ago, it is said to
have contained but one hundred houses; it has now
several thousands, and many of them very handsome;
more to say, it has some good and wide streets, with well-paved
broad foot-ways of brick, and a market street, only
in part finished, upon the model of that at Philadelphia:
its Court-house, a miserable brick building, stands well
and airy in a large square which may some time or other
be neat: in and near the town is a manufactory or two.
The College or public seminary<a name="FNanchor_31_85" id="FNanchor_31_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_85" class="fnanchor">31</a> is well situated at the
eastern entrance of the town; it is a handsome building
but within in a bad state; at present there are about one
hundred pupils. The inn, or tavern to which I was recommended,
and where I met with much civility and
attention; had any thing rather than cleanliness or comfort,
[75] but the charges as high as if both had been to
the utmost wish;<a name="FNanchor_32_86" id="FNanchor_32_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_86" class="fnanchor">32</a> myriads of bugs as usual; we literally
found rest in getting up, and much mental relief in quitting
the town, though strongly persuaded to stay that we
might behold the horsemanship of a Mr. West and his troop
from England!</p>

<p>One circumstance however should make me remember
Lexington with some satisfaction; with the improvidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
very common to travellers my resources had not been
calculated properly, and I began to find that the purse
would be emptied before we should gain the place of the
next expected remittance. In this dilemma I sought the
residence of the Cashier of the United States branch Bank,
and stated the case to him; upon which he in the most
gentlemanly manner cashed my draft: to the same gentleman
on my return I was again beholden for assistance in
managing an exchange of notes, and he may rest assured
I shall not soon forget his urbanity.</p>

<span class="caption">Frankfort, Kentucky</span>
</div>


<h3>FRANKFORT</h3>

<p>The approach, as well as the country immediately [76]
around this capital of Kentucky, is beautiful; the size of
the town may be considered about that of one of our
better market towns: some of the private houses very
well built of brick (the general material here) and very
handsomely fitted up within. The building in which the
senate of thirty-one Members, and the body of Representatives
of about ninety, meet, is a fine object on entering
the town from the western bridge; the Court-house is a
very neat building and the whole effect renders it a far
preferable residence to Lexington, except perhaps with
a view to trade; and of that there seems very little. We
found here an excellent tavern and hotel for families lately
established by Colonel Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_33_87" id="FNanchor_33_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_87" class="fnanchor">33</a> one of the old revolutionary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
officers: the building and interior would not disgrace
our own capital, and our meals were served with every
comfort and polite attention from his lady.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry both at Lexington and Frankfort I find
that the price of land is about one-sixth of what it was
three years ago; good land which then sold round Lexington
for two hundred dollars per acre, may be bought now
even for twenty-five,&mdash;and considerable tracts lying between
the above towns for five and six dollars per acre.</p>

<p>[77] On leaving Frankfort about a mile, the western
road leads winding up a considerable hill, from whence
we were gratified with a fine view of the town and the
surrounding woodland scenery: the day being beautiful,
and time allowing, I determined to put up at the first
house where we could find shelter for the horses, and return
to sketch it: accordingly, we made up to a very respectable
looking farm-house and asking permission to put the
horses into a stable, it was granted; while this was doing
I was in courtesy thanking the owner and expressing hopes
that we should not put him to any inconvenience, when
the inhospitable brute suddenly stopped me with "you
need not be so full of your thanks for I mean to charge
you for it!"&mdash;To be sure I lost no more time in compliments
but, returning to the view, finished the sketch, and
after a pleasant walk renewed my journey paying for
shelter only above half a dollar; however I first lectured
them until they were perhaps a little ashamed, but they
took the money and we drove on, descanting upon the
virtue of hospitality, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>


<h3>LOUISVILLE<a name="FNanchor_34_88" id="FNanchor_34_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_88" class="fnanchor">34</a></h3>

<p>A handsome town, of which the chief part is in one
street. Here are two good hotels at one [78] of which
(Allen's, a good family house,) we met with every attention
on our return; but now, a cleaner looking house farther
on inviting us, and being repelled by a crowd of travellers
of all descriptions and variety of dress, smoking and
lounging at the doors of the other two, we drove past;
forgetting "farther on you may fare worse," which we
certainly did.<a name="FNanchor_35_89" id="FNanchor_35_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_89" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>On settling an innkeeper's account I said that if we
might judge by the charges, a man must soon become
rich in his business; which he acknowledged would be the
case were it not for bad notes and bilking customers,
anecdotes of whom he told several: one young man after
running a bill of three hundred dollars rode out one
morning, as accustomed, to take the air and <i>forgot to return</i>;
others have watched the departure of the steam
vessels and set off to New Orleans, having <i>reckoned without
their host</i>, so that the losses are immense. These hints
and others, I did not unfortunately hear until on my return,
or I should not probably have been induced to trust to
American honour in way of business so much as I did to
my cost.</p>

<p>At all these houses a regular clerk and bar-keeper [79]
is maintained with whom the traveller <i>goes</i> to settle, for
a bill is never brought as in England; no ringing of the
bell here and, when the waiter comes bowing in, "Desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
my bill immediately"&mdash;no; that would not suit with
independence.</p>

<p>The bed of the river is here of vast breadth, and during
the spring must afford a grand view when the waters are
struggling with and rushing over the extensive rocky falls;
at present a very small channel is sufficient for its reduced
stream; people are employed on the dry bed in deepening
the intended course for the boats, arks, &amp;c. when the
waters shall next rise to afford them a passage. Travellers
of curiosity can now traverse on wheels, with a guide, the
greatest part of the rocks over which in a few months a
mighty body of waters will roll with tremendous force.</p>


<h3>INDIANA</h3>

<p>Three miles beyond Louisville the western road again
brings you to the Ohio; and by a very ill conducted and
apparently rather dangerous ferry we were wafted over,
(after waiting for our turn with many waggons, &amp;c. above
three [80] hours,) and entered the State of Indiana at the
town of New Albany;<a name="FNanchor_36_90" id="FNanchor_36_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_90" class="fnanchor">36</a> where we found a very comfortable
reception at the excellent family tavern kept by Dr. Hales,
a physician. We had hitherto been frequently received
by Representatives, Colonels, Majors, 'Squires, and
Captains; these now sometimes give place to the medical
profession. An American may be proud of his liberty,
but the pride of a gentleman never stands in the way of
a profitable speculation; idleness only is here a disgrace,
and if a man of liberal education finds that his profession
will not sufficiently remunerate him it is thought right
that he should seek profit in trade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>I had quitted the State of Kentucky with impressions
in its favour far stronger than that of Ohio had produced;&mdash;the
climate is fine, the land fertile and well cleared,
and inclosed; the houses well built, and the landscape as
we passed frequently beautiful. But this is a slave State;
and as this degraded situation of a part of our species has
excited the horror of philanthropists on our side the
globe, I will stop to say a few words on the subject; my
observations being understood to be confined solely to
the few slave States I have seen, and disclaiming, at the
same time, all theoretic approbation of the institution. I
have read, as others, with feelings of disgust [81] and injured
pride of humanity, of estates to be sold with so
many slaves upon them; and of the floggings unmerciful
which authors have related; and, drawing conclusions
from such statements, I expected to see the slave, in misery
and wretchedness, bent down with labour and hard-living,
but was very agreeably surprised to find the reverse.
Slavery is not here what it <i>may be</i> in our Colonies and
perhaps, as I believe it is still worse, in the old quarters
of the globe. By the spirit of the laws the black is here
<i>indirectly</i> benefitted: though a slave, he is suffered to
associate with his fellows, and one day in the seven
(Sunday) is set apart for society with each other; and
though there may be instances of cruel punishment, yet
so numerous are the blacks becoming that it will soon be
dangerous, if the time is not already arrived, for such instances
to be repeated. And here lies the real objection
to these slave States; the slaves begin to know their own
strength, and probably would not long bear oppression.
To see their well-proportioned figures easy and unconstrained,
and lively countenances, a stranger might be led
to think that <i>they</i> were in fact the masters of the ill-formed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
emaciated, care-worn whites, were it not for the fine clothing
of the latter: in short they are well clothed, fed, and
taken care of, and [82] so numerous that I believe they
are felt already in many places rather a burthen on the
community than an advantage. As to the work they do,
as far as I have had an opportunity to see, I should say
it is so little, that an English labourer would with ease
accomplish more in a day than two of them; and excepting
a few of the <i>old school</i>, it is the general sentiment of the
best informed Americans that they should be better off
without slaves. But the sins of the fathers have fallen
upon their sons, and, as far as human foresight may look
into futurity, they never can get rid of the effects; they
must always have an immense black population to support,
unless indeed the period shall ever arrive when the
latter shall change stations and <i>support them</i>.</p>

<p>We now meet at least as many parties going eastward
as on the western route, which might be rather discouraging
to those not accustomed to American restless search
after gain; in this, all considerations of comfort, or attachment
to home are lost. He makes a pig-inclosure of logs,
a stable of the same, open to all the winds and to the poultry,
and if his log house will keep out the worst of the
weather it is sufficient: and thus, with such buildings,
with just as much corn and fother as will keep him, his
family, and his stock, the [83] settler passes his indolent
days; smoking under the shed of his habitation, and waiting
for some good offer for what he terms his improvement;
when he immediately loads his waggon with his
furniture and family, and without the shadow of regret
leaves his abode to seek some other equally uncomfortable.</p>

<p>This State in respect to cultivation bears not at present
any comparison with its neighbour, but in natural beauties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
far exceeds it. The variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers
is great; the colours of the latter gratifying the eye in all
the gay luxuriance of nature;&mdash;the timber trees grow
to an enormous size; I measured an Oak which at four
feet from the ground was twenty-four feet in circumferance,
but there are larger trees here. We passed (<i>chemin
faisant</i>) through several new settlements called by the
people Towns, and which indeed may soon deserve the
name; roads, bridges, mills for sawing, and other buildings&mdash;every
thing in short, goes on with that spirit of
enterprise which, in spite of poverty, is shewn by the
people of America.</p>

<p>Paoli stands very pleasantly: Hindostan, on a branch
of the White river communicating with the Ohio by the
Wabash, also is <i>to be</i> a town of great trade: Washington
is perhaps the worst situated for trade<a name="FNanchor_37_91" id="FNanchor_37_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_91" class="fnanchor">37</a> but the land
around it is [84] very fertile. There are also many other
intended to-be towns, but at present containing about
half a dozen log huts, such as Greensville, Brownsville,
Fredericksberg, &amp;c. &amp;c. called thus after the first proprietor
of the land, who, if he is so fortunate as to make
choice of a favourable situation, rapidly makes his fortune
by the quick influx of settlers; but this is not always the
case and there are many "Villes" and "Bergs" which
will probably long remain as we found them.</p>

<p>At Hindostan I met with an adventure which, considering
how little respect is paid to any law, I might perhaps
as well have avoided. At a miserable log tavern there,
kept open (and to all the winds) by a Colonel, the enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>tainment
both for man and horse was the worst we had
lately met with&mdash;the hay it was pretended was too far
off to fetch; and a few heads of Indian corn was all we
could procure for the horses. For ourselves, after a
miserable meal, we found a bed laid in an out-house,
which also served for lumber-room and larder. All this
travellers must learn chearfully to bear, but another evil,
which too frequently follows, the high charges, it is not
so easy to pay with good humour: in this case I ventured,
as I had hitherto done with good effect, to reason
against one or two of the items in a quiet delicate way fit
for the ears [85] of an independent; but here it did not
succeed, for my Colonel turned upon his heel saying, if I
objected to his charges he would take nothing at all, and
away he went. I had a great mind to take him at his
word on account of his treatment; but after waiting for
his return some time, with my horses at the door, I at
length left with the Colonel's lady more than sufficient to
defray the proper legal charge according to the rate made
out by their magistrates, to which however few of them
pay much attention: well, we then drove on, but had not
got to the river side before a lad was sent after me with the
money, for the Colonel had in fact been hiding to see
what I would do, and coming out from his hole to hear
what had been left for him, preferred venting his spite
even before his money. I now determined to see how
this would end, and therefore put the money into my
pocket, drove down to the river side, and leaving my
name and address at a store there for him, crossed the ford
and proceeded. An hour or two after, my gentleman
passed me on horseback, pale, "spiteful and wrathful,"
and we kept a good look out, a little apprehensive of being
<i>rifled at</i> from behind the trees; so we got the arms out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
ready; and drove on with circumspection to the town of
Washington about eighteen miles from [86] Hindostan.
Here he had collected more people than I should have
supposed possible in the short time, and had prepared his
dramatis person&aelig;, one of whom came immediately to
arrest me; with this fellow I went to attend another whom
they called a 'Squire, a whisky seller. At this respectable
tribunal of the wilderness I stated my case with some
difficulty from the noise and opposition, and expecting as
much justice as I found, the 'Squire said the bill must be
paid without referring to the rates; and as curiosity not
resistance was my object, I at length paid it with about
a quarter dollar, no great fee for his worship. Upon this,
the Colonel was so elated with his victory that to shew
his generosity, he said, he would treat his friends with
half a dozen of wine and give the amount of his bill away;
being satisfied with "shewing <i>the Englishman</i> that he was
not to be imposed upon;" and it was in fact this rancor
against an Englishman, (not the first time I heard, it had
been shewn by him in the present way;) and which indeed
is very general, that had actuated him from our arrival
at his log palace.</p>

<p>From the effects of wine added to the elation of spirits
from victory, I fully expected the affair would not end yet,
and, determined not to avoid any thing they might intend,
I paced [87] before the tavern and mixed with the people
in the general room; but whether the wine was put off for
a glass round of the 'Squire's whiskey, or that it was
swallowed quickly I know not, in a very short time they
all quietly departed, and not a word or look could be construed
insulting. This we must own would not have been
the case while such feelings were afloat in some other countries,
and was either very much to their credit or occa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>sioned
by a party against their proceedings, several of
whom told me they had acted wrong and illegally.</p>

<p>While the towns are rapidly rising into being and improvement,
the inhabitant of the wood, vegetating in his
log cabin, seems to remain without increase of comforts,
as he is without emulation to spur him on to obtain them.
Being now beyond the boundaries of any regular tavern,
necessity threw us upon seeking shelter for the night, in
several of such habitations, open to every breath of the
winds without, and swarming within with fleas, bugs,
and other vermin: these are called "houses of entertainment;"
they are known to those who cross this at present
wilderness under such appellatives as "Preacher
Biram's," "Preacher Blair's," "Widow More's," &amp;c.
At one of these, where, except a wretched shed behind
for a kitchen, [88] there was only one room for all
the purposes of life, we had put up for the night,
and after such a supper as the house afforded, had lain
down to endeavour to rest; not sleep, for that, not to
mention the company above alluded to, would have been
sufficiently prevented by the knives and forks of my host
and his family at supper in the adjoining shed. After
having watched for the end of this, with some hope that
we might get sleep, and hearing at length the welcome
sounds of putting away, I had just addressed myself to
Morpheus, when a general chorus in all keys suddenly
burst upon my ears&mdash;they had commenced at eleven
o'clock at night their evening's devotion, put off perhaps
by our arrival: when the psalm was ended, which was
sung <i>a pleine gorge</i>, the preacher read a long homily, which
took up near an hour more, and which finished the business,
and quiet seemed likely to reign, when just as I had
composed myself suddenly some one jogged my shoulders;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
it was my hostess come to tell me that two gentlemen, one
a Dr. *****, and both particular friends of theirs had arrived,
and wished to have supper in the room, however
that it need not at all disturb us, as they were very nice
gentlemen. However I strongly objected to this proposal;
and after some demur [89] the gentlemen condescended
to take their supper in the place which had just served for
the domestic chapel and kitchen, and which I believe
afterwards was the general dormitory of the party; after
keeping it up very jovially until one or two o'clock of the
morning, by which time the bugs, assisted by the light
troops, had stormed and taken all my defences, and for
the rest of the time effectually "murdered sleep."</p>

<p>The reader will not here mistake so far as to suppose I
mean to treat lightly domestic worship, an observance for
which we should all be better, and for which I could not
but respect my host, hoping he was sincere in it; nor
should the traveller be soured by the charges after such
<i>entertainment</i>, as he is too apt to be; but he should consider
that he had met with the best reception in the power
of the people to give: their only beds are given up for his
convenience, while they probably sleep on a bench or on
the ground, and if money is the view chiefly in all this, let
money be freely given to discharge the obligation. I was
angered with much more reason at my host's attempt to
inveigle my man-servant from me with offers of twenty
dollars per month, his board, &amp;c.: these religious people
are but too apt to disregard moral conduct as a thing altogether
of [90] this world: many similar offers had I believe
been made to him, which sufficiently proves the
scarcity of active hands, and that such need not fear to
want situations.</p>

<p>Long before we approach the neighbourhood of Vin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>cennes
the woodland opens here and there into what are
termed <i>barrens</i>; these are not generally flat but undulated,
and covered with stunted oak, low beautifull shrubs, &amp;c.;
belted in with trees so fancifully disposed that one is apt
to imagine the hand of art to have been employed: the
land is not considered in general as of even second-rate
quality, but it is dry and healthy, and, when cultivated,
brings good corn if the summer is at all favourable; indeed,
under the present drought I saw some fair crops at
the few spots where <i>squatters</i> had fixed themselves. These
barrens increase in size and number as we proceed westward,
until they end in the so much talked of <i>prairie</i> or
wild meadows; in the midst of one of which, and upon
the Great Wabash river stands the pleasant town of Vincennes,
upon a sandy gravel sub-soil with excellent springs
of water. Before we arrived at Vincennes, however, an
adventure awaited us. We had baited at a house which
we were told was but six miles from the town, and forgetting
there is in these latitudes no twilight, had [91] staid
too long, and in consequence found ourselves in complete
darkness just on entering upon a large prairie; the road,
which was nothing more than wheel-tracks could no
longer be discerned, and I was obliged to direct two of our
party to precede the carriage and find the way by feeling,
not by seeing the track. In this manner we had not gone
far when the guides stopped, declaring they heard the
growl of some wild beast before them,&mdash;bears, wolves,
and panthers, all of which I had just heard of, immediately
came to mind, and I pulled up the horses to listen; when a
tremendous roar was heard directly, succeeded by another
which brought our guides, who were females, back upon
the waggons, declaring that the animal approached. Very
unwilling for the engagement, I then cocked my pistols,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and calling to the man to do the same awaited for some
time the attack; but finding the enemy did not come forward,
I ventured to drive on, and soon discovered the object
of our alarm to be a bull, which had probably been as
much discomfited at our approach as we at his roars. We
now resumed our stations, and though rain added to the
dreariness of our situation, I had the satisfaction to find
that all acted with spirit. After a doubtful march, which
seemed of much longer duration than it really [92] was,
we at length discovered some lights at a distance, and
shortly after a horseman passed who gave us the welcome
assurance that we were in a right direction; so completely
dark was it however that even when we approached the
town we could not find any track by which to enter it.
In this dilemma, amidst a pouring rain, we were again
aided by a good-natured Irishman, whose house we by
chance came up against; for he mounted along side of my
driver and piloted us to a tavern, glad enough to be relieved
from cold, wet, dirt, and darkness, a good preparation for
the enjoyment of a comfortable supper and bed, free from
unpleasant bed-fellows.</p>


<h3>VINCENNES, (INDIANA)</h3>

<p>This settlement, founded by some French families from
Canada, though one year older than Philadelphia cannot
like it boast of great extent and opulence;<a name="FNanchor_38_92" id="FNanchor_38_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_92" class="fnanchor">38</a> it has not yet
by any means lost its cabin appearance, though the beneficial
effects of the New Orleans market are beginning to
be very apparent; and good brick dwellings are fast erecting
in the best situations, behind which its log huts are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
hiding their diminished [93] heads. A very good building
of brick intended for a public school, has been erected by
the aid of ample funds left by an individual for the purpose;
yet, owing to strange neglect, the institution is suffered
to go to decay and no master has been provided.
A handsome house belonging to a General Harrison, the
chief proprietor here, is also in a dilapidated state, the
General having left it to reside elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_39_93" id="FNanchor_39_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_93" class="fnanchor">39</a> Further on,
by the water-side, we visited a steam mill upon an extensive
scale; which grinds corn, saws timber into boards, and
cards wool and cotton; a most beneficial establishment for
the surrounding country, though I was told, not just now
a good concern to the proprietors. These, with two
middling taverns, and a few substantial houses lately
erected constitute the chief buildings; the rest are a heap
of wooden huts occupied by traders in skins, and various
other things with the natives. The Wabash, a fine river,
floats the produce of this commerce and of the land, down
to the Ohio, from whence it is conveyed to New Orleans
chiefly in steam boats which return laden with goods for
their market at an enormous profit. To elucidate a little
the nature of this trade I enter a few memoranda.</p>

<p>Indian corn or maize is bought here of the farmer at
about a quarter dollar the bushel, soon [94] after harvest;
in spring it is sent down the river to New Orleans under a
freight of another quarter dollar per bushel; and is sold
there from seventy-five cents (three shillings and sixpence)
to a dollar. Wheat is bought at a price about sixpence or
sevenpence the bushel dearer than maize, and sells proportionally
higher.</p>

<p>For a return lading, Salt is bought at half a dollar per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
bushel, and sells at Vincennes from two $ to two and a
quarter $ ditto.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Loaf sugar sells at half a dollar, (2s. 3d.) per lb.<br />
Brown sugar sells at 37&frac12; cents, (1s. 8d.) per lb.<br />
Coffee at 75 cents, (3s. 6d.) per lb.<br />
Tea at from 2&frac12; $ to 3&frac12; $ per lb.<br />
</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p class="noidt">and other groceries, many of which like the above are
bought for considerably less than half their selling price,
in proportion: of iron and drugs I could not obtain the
price at New Orleans; but of the profit on the iron the
reader may judge by the price I paid to a blacksmith for
eight new horse-shoes, steel toes, and eight removes; the
bill for which was about ten dollars,&mdash;above two guineas!
I remonstrated and appealed in vain, the bill was paid;
yet I cannot think that such a price is charged to the inhabitants
among themselves; but there is no justice and
little law but one's own arm; and [95] a man must be fain
to yield before a nest of &mdash;&mdash; who join in plucking a
stranger; indeed, he may think himself well off if they
are contented with a little plucking at his purse, for instances
are not unfrequent of individuals among them
being "rifled" for having rendered themselves obnoxious;
which they do equally if they are too good (<i>honest</i>) or too
bad (<i>deep</i>) for them; or not holding themselves sufficiently
upon a level.</p>

<p>I did not learn the exact offence for which a deed of
this nature was perpetrated with impunity at a recent
period not many miles from this place, in the Prairie
country, but the facts are as follows:&mdash;A party proposed
to each other coolly to go and shoot neighbour ***** who
had behaved ill to them at sundry times; it was agreed
upon; they went to his field, found the old man at plough
and with unerring aim laid him dead!&mdash;Mr. Flower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
himself related to me this atrocious affair, and I did not
hear that any punishment was ever talked of. Such is
the state of things in this western paradise! A beautiful
garden indeed it is from the hands of nature, and with
but a little industry a most desirable country to dwell in
... with a people who do not shoot each other: but for a
man of orderly habits and civilized manners, to leave his
every comfort, plunge into this wilderness, [96] and sit
himself down among a set of half savages far more expert
that he can be in every thing essential to such a life!&mdash;'tis
a strange anomaly, and I think, "cannot come to
good." The young, the enterprising, the man who seeks
a fortune, may find a field for successful exertion&mdash;with
great circumspection in undertakings, and great good
luck in escaping bad notes and bad debts, large profits
may accrue to industry; but let no one, who already may
possess the comforts of life, seek fortune, freedom or bliss
in this western speculation; for if he does, the chances are
great that he will lose all.</p>

<p>Though the profits of trade here may be even more
favourable than above stated, yet are there great risks,
which ought to be taken into the contemplation of those
who may be inclined, by these accounts, to the enterprise.
Among the risks, one of the greatest arises from the not
uncommon accident of boats sinking, as no care however
great, will at all times prevent them from running upon
hidden trunks of trees, when they almost to a certainty
go down if heavy laden; and in such cases all the perishable
part of the cargo is either lost or much damaged: a
catastrophe not to be guarded against, as in Europe, by
insurance; there not being at present any means of effecting
it here. A more [97] safe speculation seems to be that
of the builder, and as far as I could learn, equally profit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>able;
the house in which I was, built of boards, and
which was said to cost about two hundred and twenty-five
pounds sterling, gains a rent of two hundred and fifty
dollars clear of all deductions. There are I have little
doubt, many other channels of profitable employment,
and upon the whole it may be said, that this town offers
a station for young men of prudence, spirit, and a little
capital, where they may make a fortune; it is also a dry
healthy delightful country. As to the morals and religion
of the inhabitants, I cannot say that with respect to either
they appear in a very favourable light, if one may judge
from any outward observances of the latter, or conduct
respecting the first, in affairs of business. Sunday is so
little marked as a day of rest or religious duty that I believe
no attention is paid to it, (except by the French
catholics, who have a wooden chapel;) and a stranger, who
should arrive on a Sunday, might well be led to conclude
that it was a colony of Jews rather than of Christians, and
that their sabbath had been kept the day before; tradesmen
I saw carrying goods; farmers <i>hauled</i> their corn; and
the water-mill went merrily round.</p>

<p>The price of labour is apparently high; a carpenter [98]
or bricklayer receives two dollars and his board per day;
but as competition increases I will not recommend the
mechanic to rely upon getting such wages: and if he should,
he must take notice that the high price he must pay for
most articles of necessity, will bring his wages down nearer
to a level with other places than he might at first suppose;
to be sure, there is here less competition at present.</p>

<p>Having examined the town, and both ourselves and
horses sufficiently rested, we made the necessary inquiries
and preparations to proceed to the English Prairie in the
Illinois State; from thence intending to visit the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Settlement called Harmony on the Wabash, and returning
to winter at Vincennes. Receiving however, meanwhile,
a pressing invitation to accompany a gentleman to his
country house about twenty miles distant, it being represented
as little deviating from our intended route, I accepted
of it; the more inclined perhaps, because of his
pleasing manners, and his being a native of the northern
part of my own country. Having however a little apprehension
as to the fitness of the roads we were going to pass
over for wheels, I inquired of him whether they would
permit a carriage to travel; and all my doubts were removed
by his answer that "they were [99] as good as the
town street," where we happened to be standing: we
shall soon see how accurate his account turned out to be.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in the latter part of September,
that we started on this expedition in my Dearborn; our
friend on horseback leading the way. We drove along a
good turf road across the fine plain of Vincennes, fully
expecting to get on as smoothly and pleasantly as a gig
party on a Sunday excursion along what are called the
"green lanes," around our own metropolis;&mdash;we were
not long suffered to enjoy these pleasing anticipations
however, for our guide suddenly turned into the wood and
the wheels came bump upon our old acquaintance a stump
road.&mdash;While we are getting on slowly upon it, I will just
give a slight description how such tracts are formed;&mdash;imagine
a woodland in a state of nature: through this,
guiding themselves by compass, people get on as they can,
chopping a piece of bark from the trees in the line, which
they call "blazing," as a direction to those who follow
with tools to cut down the trees between those blazed,
which they do at about a foot to a foot and a half from the
ground, leaving the stumps and brushwood standing. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a short time this latter gets worn away, but the stumps
remain a long while; and between these, horsemen, waggons,
and other [100] carriages proceed, steering between,
or bumping upon them, which is at times unavoidable,
and week after week I have driven to my own astonishment
how escaping, winding about among these stumps,
progressing at most not more than three miles an hour.
Were the "four in hand" thought I, to try their skill on
these roads, many a wreck would soon strew the ground.</p>

<p>But to return to our adventure; for our companion calls,
and presses me to urge forward the horses; advice needless
to give, for alas! we could not adopt it. The small track
became more blind; our guide appeared to be confused;
and not a little to my dismay and vexation, instead of road
as good as Vincennes town-street, we were at length entangled
in woodland; brushing through breaking boughs,
going in and out through bogs, and lifting the wheels over
dead fallen trees as we could. In this situation, as difficult
to retreat as advance, I knew not what to do and began to
suspect some foul play; but recollecting the respectable
character our companion bore at Vincennes, I dismissed
the thought, and being both myself and servant armed I
resolved to try to proceed; so calling in a peremptory tone
to our friend in advance to keep in sight, for I fancied he
seemed to be uneasy at his situation, and he at times [101]
disappeared, I asked him, not if this was his excellent road&mdash;I
was too vexed for that, but how much farther such
difficulties would be found: he answered not far; that we
were near the river, and that we would cross it at a nearer
ferry than he had at first intended; adding, he would ride
on and get the boat ready, he vanished, after pointing the
way we were to follow.</p>

<p>I now thought he was gone, and had left us in the lurch;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
however we got on by degrees, and at length had the pleasure
to see the river side, and our friend waiting for us
with the crazy ferry boat, into which with some difficulty
we got the carriage. Our difficulties were now to cease he
said, and a good road the rest of the way was to reward our
exertions; for better assurance of these good tidings I endeavoured
to obtain some information from the boatmen
as we crossed the Wabash; but they proved to be Canadian
French, and we did not sufficiently understand their
"<i>patois</i>" to gain any satisfactory account from them.
We landed safely; and after rising the river bank, actually
did find a tolerable good woodland road for some miles,
until it approached without much hinderance a small
settlement, dignified with the name of Palmyra; a place
which to all appearance need not hope for the prosperity
so [102] much as it may fear the lot, of its prototype.
Here we found a log tavern, however, and we halted to
consider what to do; for the day was closing and I remembered
there would be no twilight. In this dilemma I again
suffered myself to be guided by our companion, who represented,
that at this log inn we should not find any accommodations,
either for ourselves or horses beyond shelter,
that his house was now but three short miles further upon
a good road; and that he had provided every thing for our
comfort as well as that of our cattle: yielding to these
pressing arguments, the rather too as he seemed a little
chagrined at my hesitation, I once more trotted on, which
the horses could well do, for about half a mile beyond the
settlement. But how shall I describe what followed!
Our guide turned again into the wood calling out that it
was his <i>private road</i>: and private indeed we found it, for
we soon lost all track and light together.</p>

<p>There was now no retreating, so summoning up more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
resolution from despair, I urged and encouraged my good
little horses, and they dragged the carriage at the constant
risk of our necks, through brushwood, over fallen trees,
down and up precipitous banks and deep gullies, which I
could scarcely discern, and which if I could have seen
should not have attempted; [103] until I became so
enraged at the man's deception that had he given the least
provocation I believe I should have shot him; however he
luckily avoided this by keeping a little in advance, and
mildly calling out now and then to direct the way saying we
were very near; and indeed, long after day had departed,
we halted at a gate. Here he advised us to get out and
walk, as the way, up to the house for wheels was circuitous;
out therefore we got, when I perceived approaching,
carrying a light, a human figure in form, dress, and manner
as wild and complete a ruffian as ever Shakspeare
pourtrayed.</p>

<p>To this being, whose appearance, and the friendly shake
of the hand given him by my conductor, did not tend to
relieve my mind from suspicions of I knew not what, I
was fain to give up my horses; he returned a surly answer
in French to Mr. ***** who had said something I did not
understand, and receiving the reins from me jumped into
the carriage and drove away; but not alone, for I directed
my man to go with him; a service he probably did not
much relish, but which in my then state of mind I thought
necessary. I now explored my way towards a light, and
soon came up to a portico which had the appearance of
being built in good style: here too I had the satisfaction to
[104] meet the carriage, which I had no sooner come up to,
than a voice which seemed of stentorian power hailed me
from the portico with a torrent of words, amongst which
what struck me most was, "You have got here but you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
will never get away again!" My host who had approached
to press me to enter his house, seemed to put this off with
a smile <i>not quite easy</i>; and I declined quitting my horses
being determined to see them into the promised stable;
but upon expressing this intention the ill omened voice
again thundered, "Oh, there is no place for your horses
but this,&mdash;they will be safe enough,&mdash;they cannot <i>get
out</i>."&mdash;"But they are warm," said I; "have had a long
pull ever since noon without bait, and will catch cold out
of a stable." "Can't help it" was the answer; but just
after he added, "to be sure there is a log place, but it has
no roof!" My host now again returned to invite me in;
and under his assurance that the horses should have every
care taken of them, and knowing that my own man would
do his best for them, I reluctantly gave up the point;
mounted a flight of steps, crossed the Piazza, and entered
a room not calculated to make amazement cease. It was
spacious, lofty, well-proportioned, and finished in every
part in the very best style of workmanship: a good wood
fire [105] blazed upon a beautiful polished grate, the appertenances
to which were equally handsome; a marble
chimney piece, the tables, chairs, the supper table, and
lights supported in handsome branches, all which is commonly
seen in good houses, was here, surrounded by
prim&aelig;val wilderness; an accomplishment so wonderful
that it seemed not to be within any power short of those of
necromancy, and when my mind glanced back upon the
way we had been led, I might fairly suspect the person who
had done it to have some credit at the court of his Satanic
Majesty. Such thoughts however were well dispelled by
a neat supper, served in a manner corresponding with the
appearance of the place; and by the aid of some excellent
wine our spirits began to flow as the impressions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
day's adventures were, for a while, lost in social converse.
Our host I found to be a man of the world; knowing perfectly
well how, and practising that which he knew, to be
agreeable; full of anecdote, which he gave well; and after
keeping it up to a late hour we retired to rest in a handsome
adjoining chamber.</p>

<p>Rising with the early sun, refreshed from the harass of
the preceding day, I walked out anxious to explore the
lodgings of my four-footed companions, not much expecting
to find that "every [106] care" had been taken of
them; indeed after a considerable search I at length discovered
the place of their confinement, in an inclosure of
logs without the slightest roof; of course they looked piteously,
for the nights had become rather keen and frosty.
Perhaps it may be thought by some readers that too
much has been said of the dumb servants; but let
those who think so either take a journey, during which
their lives shall constantly depend upon the steadiness
of their horses or at least let these objectors reflect,
that during such daily acquaintance a sort of mute
friendly understanding takes place between the driver
and his cattle;&mdash;they will then no longer wonder at
his anxiety for their welfare. And here let us bring
this strange adventure to a close; we passed two days very
pleasantly, during which we met with the most attentive
hospitality, and I am unwilling to search for other motive;
though, perhaps, it might principally be to induce me to
engage in aid of a scheme to build mills upon a favourable
situation on the Wabash river: this I mention, in order
to take the opportunity of cautioning emigrants against
engaging in the schemes, generally delusive, of the old
settler or the American. However plausible they may
appear, let him be the more cautious; it may happen that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
[107] they answer&mdash;some do so; but nine individuals in
ten of those who are drawn in are ruined notwithstanding;
for they get wheedled out of their property by
trick and chicanery, which the American laws too much
favour.</p>

<p>Let those therefore who come into this country, and
bring capital with a view to settle, take good care not to
be in the least haste to lay it out: let them keep their money
in their pockets and view a speculation on all sides; nay,
turn it inside out before they venture a dollar in it: and
above all, let the emigrant distrust his own judgment, and
ever keep in mind that the American upon his own soil is
in business and speculation an overmatch for Europeans.
One material reason for which is, that he is not at all nice
or scrupulous about the means, so he attains his end; which
is money,&mdash;money,&mdash;for ever, money. It is therefore
much safer for an emigrant to embark in business by himself
than to trust his property in partnership; in the first
case, he may at least know how he is going on; in the last,
it is probable he never will until too late.</p>

<p>An instance of the result of delusive expectations, may
be seen in the man who has been an inmate a long time
past with my present host, and from whom the words of
ill-omen proceeded on the night of our arrival. He was
[108] born in a manufacturing district in England and
brought up a builder and cabinet-maker: discontented, as
truly too many have had reason to be, with the remunerations
of his business he embarked, with his wife and a
decent capital in money, for America. Set ashore upon
its coast, he found not his sanguine expectations realized;
therefore wandered into the western country, working at
little gain for one person and another, until his capital was
considerably lessened: when at length he met with this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
gentleman, who engaged him to build the house in which
we have been so well entertained;&mdash;with him, he has
placed the remainder of his money, to be repaid to him
with interest whenever a large bill due for his exertions
shall be settled:&mdash;Perhaps his troubles and disappointments
in this life may be over before this happens, for a
rapid decline is carrying him off, and we will hope that
then heaven will send a protector to the widow and the
fatherless.</p>


<h3>[109] A VISIT TO THE ENGLISH SETTLEMENT
IN THE ILLINOIS</h3>

<p>On the third morning we made early preparations for
departure; and accepting gladly the offer of the builder
for a guide, we took leave of <i>Marvel Hall</i> and, not without
considerable apprehensions of difficulties to come in getting
away, started for the town of Albion, as the English
settlement is called. According to expectation the way
was not free from wood, bog, gully, and stump; but with the
aid of day these obstacles were overcome without accident;
and after having traversed several miles of woodland and
prairie, covered with long grass and brushwood, and having
lost our way once or twice, we at length crossed a narrow
forest track, and rising an eminence entered upon the so-much
talked-of <span class="smcap">Boulton House</span> Prairie; just as the sun
in full front of us was setting majestically, tinging with his
golden rays what appeared to be a widely extended and
beautiful park, belted in the distance with woodland over
which the eye ranged afar. The ground was finely
<i>undulated</i>, and here and there ornamented with interspersed
[110] clumps of the White Oak and other timber,
in such forms that our picturesque planters of highest re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>pute
might fairly own themselves outdone. The effect
was indeed striking, and we halted to enjoy it until the last
rays of the beautiful luminary told the necessity of hurrying
on to the settlement, in search of quarters for the night;
indulging by the way sanguine hopes of an English supper
and comfort as a matter of course at an English settlement.
The road was good, yet the length of way made it nearly
dark when we drove up to the log tavern; before the door
and dispersed, stood several groups of people, who seemed
so earnest in discourse that they scarcely heeded us; others,
many of whom were noisy from the effects of a visit to the
whiskey store, crowded round to look at us; and amidst
the general confusion as we carried the luggage in (having
first obtained a bed-room,) I was not a little apprehensive
of losing some of it. However, we got all safely stored,
and taking the horses off led them into a straw-yard full of
others, for there was no stable room to be had; and what
was worse no <i>water</i>, not sufficient even to sprinkle over
some Indian corn which we got for them. The landlord
did all that lay in his power, but our own fare proved little
better than that of our horses, which spoke volumes [111]
on the state of the settlement; some very rancid butter, a
little sour bread, and some slices of lean fried beef, which
it was vain to expect the teeth could penetrate, washed
down by bad coffee sweetened with wild honey, formed
our repast. We asked for eggs,&mdash;milk,&mdash;sugar,&mdash;salt;
the answer to all was "We have none." The cows had
strayed away for some days in search of water, of which
the people could not obtain sufficient for their own ordinary
drink; there being none for cattle, or to wash themselves,
or clothes. After making such a meal as we could,
and having spread our own sheets I laid down <i>armed at
all points</i>, that is with gloves and stockings on, and a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
rough flannel dressing gown, and thus defended slept
pretty well.</p>

<p>In the morning a request was sent to Mr. Birkbeck for
some water, understanding that he had a plentifully supplied
well;&mdash;the answer sent back was, that he made it a
general rule to refuse every one: a similar application to
Mr. Flower however met with a different fate, and the
horses were not only well supplied, but a pitcher of good
water was sent for our breakfast. If the first was not
punished for his general refusal the latter was rewarded
for his grant by finding on his grounds and not far from his
house, two days after, a plentiful spring of clear [112]
water, which immediately broke out on the first spit of
earth's being removed; this real treasure I saw flowing;
the discovery of it appeared miraculous in the midst of
so general a drought.</p>

<p>We now sallied out to take a view of the settlement,
which is marked out not on prairie, but on woodland, only
just partially cleared here and there where a house is built;
so that there is yet but little appearance of a town. A
very neat roofed-in building for a market first attracts the
eye; at one end, parted off with boards, and under the
same roof is a very decent place of worship; which is at
present of a size sufficient for the place.</p>

<p>While we were viewing this edifice a young Englishman
introduced himself with a welcome to us, and hopes expressed
that I should settle among them; he was, I found,
the medical man of the place, and in himself certainly
formed one inducement to stay, for he seemed to be a very
pleasant communicative man, he possessed a very prettily
finished picturesque cottage and seemed sanguine in his
hopes of the success of the settlement. We visited a
wheelwright next; one of the many who had been induced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
by Mr. Birkbeck to emigrate soon after he himself left
England:&mdash;The man's story is shortly this: he and his
brother sailed [113] for America; and were induced by Mr.
B.'s "Notes" to leave the Eastern parts where good employment
was offered to them, and to repair to the Prairies.
On arriving, he found none of the cottages ready for the
reception of emigrants which <i>his reading</i> had led him to expect,
nor any comforts whatever: he was hired however
by Mr. B., and got a log hut erected; but for six months
the food left for his subsistence was only some <i>reasty</i> bacon
and Indian corn, with water a considerable part of the
time completely muddy; while Mr. B., himself at Princetown
and elsewhere, did not, as he might have done, send
him any relief. On account of these hardships the man
left him, set up for himself, and now has, he told me,
plenty of work, but he seemed doubtful of the pay. These
are the facts as related to me by others, and corroborated
by the man:&mdash;If true, without some strong qualifying circumstances,
I leave Mr. B. to settle with his conscience
the bringing people out thus far, by his misrepresentations,
to hopeless banishment; for return they cannot, though
they would be glad so to do.</p>

<p>Our tavern-keeper, who was a very respectable farmer,
left a good farm near Baldock in Hertfordshire, guided
by Mr. Birkbeck's book, to find health, wealth, and freedom
at Boulton-house [114] Prairie: of the two first both
himself and family were quickly getting rid, while they
were absolutely working each day like horses without one
comfort left.&mdash;"How came you," said I, "to leave so good
a farm as you had in England?" His answer was, "Mr.
Birkbeck's book."&mdash;"You would be glad now to return?"
added I. "Sir," said he, "we must not think that way;
we have buried our property in getting here, and must here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
remain!" Such facts as these are worth a thousand flattering
theories on the other side; and another may be here
added,&mdash;perhaps a salutary caution to Mr. B. if this should
be the first intimation&mdash;that the angry feelings of the poor
people who had been entrapped by the deceptious colouring
of his writings, flashed out in true English threats of
tossing him in a blanket! I abstain from comment upon
this, my business being to state facts. I forbear too from
respect for a man of good natural abilities; misled himself
by a sanguine temper which has been the cause of his misleading
others: I will be silent too upon the subject of
private differences, conceiving that public acts alone are
those in which the public are interested, and ought to be
inquisitive.</p>

<p>Mr. Flower followed up his seasonable supply of water,
with a call and invitation to his house, [115] which was
gladly accepted; being much disgusted at the deplorable
state of ill health, anxious looks, despair and discontent,
depicted in so many faces around,&mdash;to relieve or even
alleviate which we possessed no means.</p>

<p>The contrast to this at Mr. Flower's was violent and
pleasing; there, we met with every polite and hospitable
attention during our stay, and from thence alone we were
grieved to depart. In the midst of these wilds the elegant
repast and social converse were again, as if by magic, enjoyed;
and in such agreeable dissipation of mind the purposes
of the journey were perhaps too much lost sight of,
and many inquiries neglected which are now causes of
regret. We did not fail however to explore the retreat of
Mr. Morris Birkbeck,&mdash;a pleasant drive across the
Prairie brought us to the Flat, at one extremity of which
Mr. B. has established himself. We found him busy
superintending the building of his house; the site of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
is within twenty yards of his erection of logs, a square
building divided into two rooms, as I heard, for we did not
see the interior of this <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> from whence
have been issued relations of so many snug cottages, with
adjoining piggeries, cow-steads, gardens, and orchards;
where the limbs of the poor emigrant were to find repose
and his [116] mind solace, not to mention the ranges of log
rooms for the arch priest himself which were building two
years ago;<a name="FNanchor_39_94" id="FNanchor_39_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_94" class="fnanchor">39*</a> all&mdash;all have vanished "into thin air," except
the humble primitive log building before mentioned.
This serves the whole family, according to the cobbler's
song,</p>

<p class="poem">
"For parlour, for kitchen and hall;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and furnishes a proof, though perhaps not sufficient for
every one, (the world is so incredulous,) of Mr. Birkbeck's
humility, for he certainly does not at present enjoy the
<i>otium cum dignitate</i> whatever he may have in prospect.</p>

<p>Up to this log building with some meandering I drove;
and seeing a little man, who by description received, appeared
to be Major domo, I sent to tell him that an English
traveller had called and begged to see his improvements;
upon which he approached, and after salutation, turning
towards and pointing to his primitive hut, observed that
it was still his residence, to which so attached had he become
that he should quit it with regret. He then drew
my attention to his new house, which he said, was building
according to a promise made to his daughters; and he
invited us to inspect it. Alighting therefore, he led the
way [117] over a sufficiently commodious dwelling, no part
of which was yet finished but the library, placed at the
gable end on the first floor and the approach to it up a high
flight of stairs on the outside of the house: here we found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the Misses B.; they were engaged in some ornamental
needlework, and received us like sensible, agreeable girls.
Upon the table lay a flute, an instrument upon which one
of them plays; and every thing was well arrayed to give
effect, as well as the sterling, good, and for a private library
large assortment of books. A fine healthy boy, his son,
came up and presented to us some bunches of wild grapes
he had just gathered, the only refreshment I believe offered;
and I took leave, after having in vain endeavoured to gain
information as to his corn-crops, the success of clover, and
other seeds.</p>

<p>This was strange, but not so particularly unaccountable
as at the time I thought it; for, I afterwards learned he had
not sown either one or the other, although he ventures to
put forth this year in one of the American newspapers,
what in charity we will suppose a day-dream&mdash;a pleasing
mental deception, in the form of a letter in which he expresses
himself thus; (I quote from memory having mislaid
the journal,) "We have now about as many acres
[118] of corn sown as there are settlers, that is seven
hundred."</p>

<p>Now, from the best inquiries I could make, there was
not then two hundred and fifty acres sown in the whole
settlement, and on Mr. Birkbeck's ground not a rood!
Therefore, it may be truly said, that the colony was still for
its existence depending for bread upon the exertions of
those who, from a distance of many miles, bought and
brought corn and flour for the market. In corroboration,
I will here insert an extract from a published journal by a
Mr. Hulme,<a name="FNanchor_40_95" id="FNanchor_40_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_95" class="fnanchor">40</a> formerly a great bleacher near Manchester,
and a friend of Mr. B., who had lately paid him a visit.
Mr. H. writes, "The whole of his operations had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
directed hitherto (and wisely in my opinion,) to building,
fencing, and other important preparations. He had done
<i>nothing in the cultivating way but make a good garden</i>,
which supplies him with the only things that he cannot
purchase, and purchase too with more economy than he
could grow them."</p>

<p>This Mr. Hulme knew the comforts and cheapness of
Philadelphia, and its market, too well to think of settling
at Boulton-house Prairie; besides, he evidently sneers, as
much as a friend can, at the choice of situation Mr. B.
has made, because it appears not to possess any [119] of
the capabilities for mills, &amp;c.: he adds, "I was rather
disappointed, or sorry at any rate, not to find near Mr.
Birkbeck's any of the means for machinery, such as waterfalls,
minerals, and mines; some of those however he may
yet find."</p>

<p>Thus has Mr. B. chosen to build a house, plant a garden,
and dwell in a situation where he cannot grow corn so cheap
as he can purchase it, and have it conveyed at a considerable
expence from the settlement of Harmony,<a name="FNanchor_41_96" id="FNanchor_41_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_96" class="fnanchor">41</a> distant
above twenty miles; in a situation too, which if it have any
recommendation at all, it must be for the purposes of
agriculture, for others it has none that are yet discovered.
This may be to the taste, and it may suit the purse of Mr.
B., and no one could fairly find fault with him for pleasing
himself; but, when he steps beyond this line, and publishes
plausible representations to induce others to seek fortune
and independence in such situations, he is then doing that
which he has no right to do, and has much to answer for:
he has led people into this wilderness where, for any thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
he has done, they may in vain look around for the expected
shelter; they will see only Mr. B's house and garden, and
perhaps [120] two or three log huts which at present constitute
the whole of the new town of Wansborough; in
short, he seems only to have thought of himself and to
have falsified his public promises. I believe it to be a
fact that the colony could not have outlived the winter of
1818, but that the whole must have been dispersed or
starved, had it not been for the exertions of Mr. Flower;
who perceived in time the coming want, and at considerable
trouble and expence obtained a sufficient and timely
supply. Mr. Birkbeck, in his publication, inveighs
strongly against land-jobbing; yet if I am correctly informed
he has obtained and is now gaining great profits
by it,&mdash;he has entered as many as thirty thousand acres,
which he now disposes of in lots as high, where he can, as
four dollars per acre; it seems indeed to be his only business,
to carry on which with better success he has given
to others, it is said, an interest in the concern to find out
and bring in purchasers of more money than judgment.
One of these jackals, reported to be so employed, I met
with on the road.</p>

<p>Having said thus much of an individual who has become
noted for promissory books, and who therefore deserves
to be noted for non-performance, let us turn to the contemplation
of that which has been accomplished by those
who did [121] not promise any thing, but who have done
much. Mr. Flower, ably assisted by his father and in
conjunction with a few others, has formed the settlement
of New Albion, (an auspicious name;) and notwithstanding
the miserably unprovided state in which I found it,
much had certainly been done, and more was rapidly doing
towards rendering the place habitable. Among other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
well-judged resolutions, they had determined, that in
future all the houses should be substantially built of bricks,
for the manufacture of which they have, as I understood,
plenty of good clay in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A neat covered market, and place of worship, as before
observed, had been finished and opened to the public; to
which I have to add that a roomy boarding house and
tavern were half up; a store (shop) pretty well supplied
was opened; a wheelwright has been already mentioned:
besides this trade many other artisans had come in, and
the chief want was a sufficiency of the several materials
of their business to work upon; but fair expectations may
be entertained that, ere this account shall be published, the
place will have become well supplied with most of the common
comforts of life, not excepting the essential of water.</p>

<p>It clearly appears, that at present the [122] produce of
the earth can be <i>bought</i> cheaper than it can be <i>grown</i>
here; but let us look forward to the period when this shall
not be the case, and the time must surely soon arrive or
the colony cannot long exist:&mdash;What then will be the
prospect of a market that the settler will have for the produce,
which shall be more than the consumption of the
neighbourhood? It is this,&mdash;at about twelve miles distance
is a place called Bon Pas, consisting of a tavern and
two or three houses, situated upon a creek communicating
with the Wabash river; to this creek, (the mud in which
not always allowing boats to come up it,) as the nearest
point from the English settlement to water carriage, all
the corn and other exportable produce must be hauled by
land; to be conveyed in boats down to Shawnee town on
the Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_42_97" id="FNanchor_42_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_97" class="fnanchor">42</a> (sixty miles,) and thence down that river and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the Mississippi to New Orleans: there to be shipped
either for Europe, or for the eastern ports of America.
It must be obvious then, that the price which can possibly
be allowed to the western grower, in order to meet the
eastern farmer on equal terms in his own market, must
ever make the business of the first a comparatively bad
one: and as it is thus in the American markets so will it
be in Europe; the freight from the eastern ports being so
much less, as [123] the distance is less, and navigation safer;&mdash;but
against this manifest disadvantage may be set the
supposed greater fertility of the western country, and the
less price of the land per acre: but it will never do.&mdash;These
advantages, if granted, are more than counterbalanced by
the higher price of all the imported articles of common
consumption.</p>

<p>The best hope of the English settlement must be, that
in the common course of events, the time may arrive when
the population will be sufficient to make its own markets;
and awaiting that period, they must be resigned to sink
their immediate interests in the prospect of laying the
foundation of future fortune for their posterity. Meanwhile,
it may have attractions for many; whether on account
of their principles religious or political, from general
turn of mind, or misfortunes met with elsewhere; to such
it may afford an asylum: but let none forget that the
comforts of life are more than cent per cent dearer (and
many are not to be obtained at all,) than they are in the
eastern States; and that for this cause, more than the
climate it is, that health is far more likely to be preserved
in the old settled country, than here.</p>

<p>The strange heterogeneous mixture of characters which
are collected hither by the magic [124] pen of Morris
Birkbeck, is truly ludicrous. Among many others, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
couple now attend to the store at Albion who lately lived
in a dashing style in London not far from Bond-street;
the lady brought over her white satin shoes and gay
dresses, rich carpets, and every thing but what in such a
place she would require; yet I understand that they have
accommodated themselves to their new situations, hand
out the plums, sugar, whiskey, &amp;c., with tolerable grace,
and at least "do not seem to mind it." At Bon Pas we
sat down to a wild turkey with a party among whom was
an <i>exquisite</i>, so complete, that had it been the age of genies,
I should have thought <i>it</i> had been pounced upon while
lounging along Rotten-row, whirled through the air, and
for sport set down in this wilderness to astonish the natives:
the whole has truly a most pantomimic effect, and Momus
might keep his court at this anomalous scene, and laugh
to his full content.</p>

<p>Let us now bid adieu to the English settlement, my
sentiments respecting which are, from what has been said,
so obvious as to render any thing more unnecessary. We
are taking the road to the German settlement called Harmony,
and will only stop the wheels to make mention of
the very complete farm yards and surrounding [125] buildings,
which Mr. Flower has erected; also of his flock,
consisting of upwards of four hundred sheep, which has
been collected in a very short space of time and part of
which he brought from England; these feed during the
day upon the prairies, and are brought into the yards at
night <i>for safety from the wolves and bears</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_98" id="FNanchor_43_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_98" class="fnanchor">43</a> A yoke of
fine oxen too were daily plowing for him the prairie land,
and preparing a considerable breadth of it for cultivation:&mdash;But
though men of capital may thus in great measure
bring many of their comforts with them, and attract<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
others, yet after all that can be said of this place it is at
present a bad concern; from which it was with no small
pleasure that I knew myself in a situation to get away;
and many,&mdash;many expressed themselves to be of the same
opinion, though with rueful faces, for they were obliged
to stay, having spent their all to get there.</p>


<h3>HARMONY</h3>

<p>From Bon Pas (the future Emporium of the commerce
of New Albion!) we soon crossed the Wabash at a ferry
of difficult approach; for the [126] river banks are steep
and high, and the descent is therefore rather dangerous
for a carriage; we got over safe however, and then keeping
the river close on the right, arrived in the evening at
the German settlement, and put up at the excellent good
tavern, neatness itself, but furnished in the very plainest
manner, and beyond a three cornered arm chair, there
was not a piece of furniture which could excite the repose
of indolence or the indulgence of luxury. After a plain
repast, accompanied however with some good beer and
a bottle of white wine, both the produce of the colony,
(for the last we paid one dollar,) we sallied out to take a
view of a place which could afford such good cheer. Before
we proceed to examine it, however, I am disposed to
talk a little of the great cementing principle of the society&mdash;<i>a
communion of goods</i>.&mdash;While the rest of mankind
are given up to a selfish principle; while each one is amassing
the possessions of this transitory scene, grasping them
truly as if he were never to part with them, these people,
under the guidance of their spiritual pastor M. Rapp,
are shewing to the world the practicability of what they
esteem the real christian principle; they are living in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
utmost harmony with a strict communion of property.
All the products of the earth, which all contribute their
share of labour [127] to produce, are deposited in the common
stock, whence each one receives whatever may be
required for his comforts. Indeed, what my host at the
tavern told me seems perfectly true; "We have every
thing we can want" says he, "for our comfort and <i>something
more</i>."</p>

<p>Nothing short of a pure religious principle (certainly
not worldly interest,) could keep such a community in
harmony; that here is an example of its doing so is at
first view highly gratifying; it gives promise that the time
may arrive when mankind may generally adopt it. Should
it stand the test, it must bring conviction to all, what some
think <i>now</i> must be the universal belief; at least <i>christians</i>
must be convinced that the institution of property, with
all its attendant "hard words, jealousies and fears" is
incompatible with a religion which proclaims "peace on
earth, good-will towards men," and prescribes mutual
love and benevolence as essential to happiness here and
hereafter.</p>

<p>This colony, (though they admit into their communion
any one, who professing their principles and submitting
to their rules wishes to be admitted among them,) is composed
chiefly of poor Germans; who have fled from a
despotic government, to enjoy quietly in this remote
scene their religion, and the fruits of their industry:&mdash;[128]
In their leader they place implicit confidence, and
obey him with promptitude; he directs the labours of the
day as well as their religious duties; and in neither is there
any perceptible distinction made between the members of
his own family and his flock. The same plain dress is
worn by all, and all equally go to the labours of the field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
To shew the extent of their reliance on, and obedience to
him, the following fact is sufficient: soon after the commencement
of their settlement M. Rapp, foreseeing the
serious difficulties which would arise from too quick an
increase of their numbers, told them it was necessary that
for the present they should not have any more children.
He was obeyed for the necessary period; but the interdiction
has been since removed and plenty of children were
to be seen in proof of it. Mr. Birkbeck has misrepresented
this temporary order as a fundamental law of the
society, and takes occasion to condemn them for it; when
in fact it was a very wise forecast, preventing the distress
which would have certainly ensued from the want of
sufficient provisions.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us now take a view of this interesting colony. The
site is obviously well chosen on a good soil, rather elevated,
and at a sufficient distance from the low grounds near the
river for [129] the advantage of a healthy air: the streets
are of spacious width crossing each other at right angles,
and lined with Lombardy poplars: the houses, which at
leisure are to be replaced by others of more durable materials,
are at present log cottages of a pleasing picturesque
plan, and very neatly thatched; to each is attached a
garden, a yard, a shed, and out-house for the cow and
other purposes, the whole having an air of great comfort.
Near the inn in a square open space stands the church,
which, though formed of wood and boarded, is a handsome
large building. On one side this square is the
house of the pastor, the materials of good brick. It is
large, and finished in the best style of workmanship. Of
the same material they have also built a spacious store
which contains articles of grocery, hardware, and indeed
every thing that the inhabitants of the surrounding country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
require, and with these it seemed to carry on great
business: this store is guarded with close iron-barred
windows, and its general appearance corresponding, I inquired
what occasion <i>they</i> had for a prison? This caution
is no compliment to the honesty of the settlers around.
A large steam mill is at work constantly, where they grind
corn, card wool, saw boards, &amp;c.: they have also thrashing
machines of great power and indeed [130] a vast
variety of other machinery; they dye cloth pretty well:
there are buildings ample for school instruction, and in
short, (for, to enumerate every thing would require a long
residence among them,) they seem to possess every comfort.
The vines were loaded with beautiful ripe grapes
both black and white; and they were fast covering the
hills of sandy soil in the neighbourhood with new vineyards.
It was the Indian-corn harvest, and the young
women and children, standing in a large circle, were employed
in stripping off the leaves and throwing the cobs
into baskets, which the men carried into the barns on
willing shoulders. We contemplated this scene with
much pleasure and then proceeded to take a view of the
country around the settlement; which we found cleared
to great extent, and sown with wheat looking luxuriantly
and promising abundance.</p>

<p>The whole here described, and probably much more
might escape observation, has been effected in the short
period of five years and a half!&mdash;They may fairly take
for their motto <i>vis unita fortior</i>, for they have accomplished
wonders by it; far more than money could have effected
with mercenary workmen, and far better too, for here is
no interest to deceive the employer; they work for themselves.
But, though inclined, [131] I must not dilate
upon this fascinating principle which seems to strike at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the root of most if not all of the moral evils of society;
heartily hoping that its practicability may stand the test,
and prove its sterling character, I shall therefore take
leave of the subject with a few more observations, which
will end what I have to say respecting this quiet industrious
people. They keep no accompts of the several
branches of their industry;&mdash;an annual taking of stock
is all they think necessary; which is done in order to
know the extent of their resources, and that they may be
able to calculate their sufficiency to the wants for the year.</p>

<p>There was, I must confess after all, a dull sameness
pervading the place, which I am willing to attribute rather
to the phlegmatic German character than to their institutions.
There is too, a depression of spirit which hangs
about every man, far removed from the country which
gave him birth, from those early scenes of childhood upon
which his eye first rested with delight, and from those
friends "he ne'er shall see again." Expatriated communities,
like plants removed from the seed bed, for
awhile sicken; but if planted in a genial soil they in time
take firm root, again spread abroad their leaves, and
flourish.</p>

<p>[132] Music they have, for we heard a grand pianoforte
well played; they may have other instruments and also
other amusements though I saw none; and their language,
which I did not understand, precluded conversation, for
no one, except my host of the tavern, not even M. Rapp,
spoke English or French. The women, to use the phrase
of a polite man, are the <i>least handsome</i> I ever beheld: the
Colony therefore may possibly not be much disturbed by
female intrigues, and thus be free from one other great
cause of embroilment among mankind. To conclude my
observations, they seem according to their own ideas a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
happy people; and did they possess a little more liveliness,
more polish, and talk English one might have lived among
them, which is more than I felt inclined to do in any other
society we met with.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 3d. We were now considerably above four
thousand miles from home. It was the original intention
that we should winter at Vincennes, on which account
various necessaries had been sent from Philadelphia as
well as brought with us; but I had already nearly <i>seen
enough</i>, and having been informed, also judging from
what I had seen,</p>

<p class="poem">
(Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent <i>river banks</i><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Morasses</i> vast and desarts idle,<br />
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven;)<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">[133] that the roads of Indiana were seldom passable for
wheels in the spring of the year, and not until the beginning
of summer, I began to think that a winter and following
spring passed in the western country, might leave
the choice of a winter passage home or the further delay
of another year; which would be too long a detainer from
old England: and we therefore entertained thoughts of
getting back before winter to one of the eastern ports,
whence, if necessary, we might embark at any time during
the winter, or otherwise to stay till spring. Not to lose
time and fair weather therefore, in getting back to Vincennes
to make arrangements for the return, we quitted
the interesting Colony of Harmony early in the morning;
having to drive thirty miles to Princetown<a name="FNanchor_44_99" id="FNanchor_44_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_99" class="fnanchor">44</a> the nearest
station. Throughout the whole of my journey, though
sometimes at a loss, I was fortunate enough not once to
lose the way; a circumstance partly owing to being very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
particular in noting directions whenever they could be
obtained&mdash;a plan that cannot be too strongly recommended
to travellers through difficult countries. Let
them not be content with directions from one individual,
but ask every one they may meet; I have often had cause
to repent confidently passing a person, and within half a
mile after have found myself in uncertainty: this [134]
was the case on leaving Harmony after obtaining what we
thought full directions; but people who know a country
are hardly ever sufficiently circumstantial to a stranger.</p>

<p>In a few miles we passed in the midst of the forest a solitary
meeting-house, and soon after met several respectable
looking people on horseback in their Sunday clothes coming
to it. We were this day probably beholden to our
fire-arms for safety; and though many travellers do not
carry them, I strongly recommend all those who have any
property not to omit it. A ruffian-looking fellow had
introduced himself to me at Harmony, under pretence of
shewing a note which he had received, he said, above
thirty miles westward, and which proving to be a forgery
he must go back to exchange. He wanted much to be informed
of my route, but this of course I avoided telling,
and thought no more of him; but to-day, instead of going
back as he had said, we suddenly saw him riding after us
upon a wretched horse, and he soon passed with such a
dogged look that I had no doubt on my mind of his intentions,
which were the more confirmed by his stopping
afterwards frequently and looking about and at us. So
we got under arms; I placing the rifle between my legs as
I drove, and the pistols at my side: he evidently wavered
[135] in his resolution, apprehensive that more people
might be near on their way to the meeting, and perhaps not
liking our number. We soon came up with him, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
at a log-hut, where he was fortifying with whiskey; and
as we marched past we took care he should see we were
prepared: he looked hard, but before we were out of sight
struck off in another direction and we saw him no more.</p>

<p>Slept at Princetown; where there was found nothing
more important to note than a tolerable good inn, and
some blackberry wine of my host's own manufacture, for a
bottle of which he had the conscience to charge a dollar,
and "by the light of the moon" next evening we got safe
back to Vincennes, and found those of our party left there
during this expedition all well. From this pleasant town
we made short excursions in the neighbourhood, and a
week passed in irresolution whether to winter or to attempt
the return at this season; for various were the representations
and advice upon the subject: among the inducements
to stay there is plenty of shooting of all kinds, the
place is healthy, and we had the offer of a furnished
house.&mdash;If the reader has been called upon to act under
circumstances where the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> have been so
equally balanced, that it seemed not possible to refer the
affair to the [136] decision of the judgment,&mdash;perhaps <i>he</i>
has tossed up. <i>I</i> did not, but I resolved to go: and having
once determined, the necessary arrangements were soon
made; the baggage waggon and its contents to a considerable
value were intrusted to the <i>honour</i> and <i>honesty</i> of
a Vincennes merchant,<a name="FNanchor_45_100" id="FNanchor_45_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_100" class="fnanchor">45</a> and with my dearborn, and luckily
all the four horses, on the 11th October, I commenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
my retreat. I intended to take the same route homeward
as far as Zanesville, (Ohio,) and from thence by a northerly
course to Lake Erie, proceed to the Falls of Niagara,
then to Albany and down the north river to New York;
but the lateness of the season afterwards induced me
reluctantly to alter the plan, and to return through Maryland.</p>

<p>In retracing our steps we shall not have occasion for
much observation, until we take new ground on entering
the State of Maryland.</p>

<p>From Vincennes the first week brought us to Louisville;
a distance of near one hundred and [137] fifty miles.
I had been instructed, by the persons who cashed my bill
at Vincennes, to consult with a broker of this town who
was requested to exchange those notes which were not at
par for others that were so, taking a per centage for the
transaction&mdash;he did so; and the reader is informed, in
order that he may have some idea of the state of the banks
and of public credit, that twenty-five per cent or one quarter
was the difference of value of notes between Louisville
and Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_46_101" id="FNanchor_46_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_101" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>The end of the second week brought us again to Maysville,
or Limestone on the Ohio, which divides Kentucky
from Ohio State. The country does not lose on the review;
even in Indiana it seems to be cultivated to greater
extent than at first sight it appeared to be; the weather is
delightful, and the various tints with which the foliage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
glows is far beyond the reach of pen or pencil. This
season is called here the <i>Indian</i> [138] <i>summer</i>, and indeed
the agreeable temperature of the air, the beauty of the
day, and the variety of forest scenery I could much wish
to describe though vain would be the attempt. Let the
reader imagine the finest autumnal day in England, and
suppose an unvaried succession of such days, as far from
oppressive heat as from cold; let him then cull from our
woods every tint of autumn's foliage, heighten every colour
in imagination, and add more; then perhaps he may have
a faint idea of the Indian summer season.</p>

<p>At Lewis's tavern in Indiana we witnessed a fine appearance
of the aurora borealis; beautiful columns of light in
constant motion and of great breadth continually darted
upward, extending and shortening by turns while others
crossed these; the whole moved gradually towards the
west. At this place we were overtaken by a lady and gentleman,
their child and nurse, returning from Lexington
from an excursion to the new settlement of Indostan on
the White river;&mdash;they travelled in their own carriage, (a
chariot) it may therefore be well supposed that the roads
were tolerably good. Their arrival caused a good deal
of consultation and contrivance for the night's accommodations;
there was but one room for both [139] parties,
which, by hanging up sheets and other substitutes for
curtains, was at length divided into four;&mdash;beds were
then spread, and all slept quietly without furnishing any
scene in which either Scarron or Fielding would have
delighted: 'tis true we set fire to the log chimney, for the night
was cold, and we had piled the faggots a little too high,
but this was luckily seen before retiring to rest, or it might
have been attended with serious consequences to us. My
host, a shrewd spirited little fellow, strutting about in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
short cloak a l'Espagnol worn here, and with his black
worsted remains of stockings full of holes, which did not
in the least damp his self-conceit, told me next morning,
on my remarking the scarcity of houses of entertainment
for travellers, that indeed another <i>good</i> house besides his
own was much wanted on the road.</p>

<p>Great is the facility of acquiring money here if a man
has judgment; he first looks out for some spot where a
tavern is wanted, he immediately cuts down the trees
around and puts together a rude log hut, which he covers
with shingles (wood tiles;) a board is then inscribed
"tavern," or "house of entertainment." Inside you find
it very sparingly furnished, but he has got some fowls and
spirits, and if he minds, his fortune is made. Travellers
are plentiful, and his charges [140] as high as if he could
treat them with every comfort, instead of putting two
people <i>commonly</i>, and sometimes three, into a bed; in a
room, too, containing four, five and six beds! The
horses are put into another inclosure of logs, the interstices
of which near a foot wide, (in summer an advantage,)
are not at all closed even during the severity of winter.</p>

<p>At Paoli town, Indiana, we arrived on the day of militia
muster, and found there a considerable concourse of people,
for it appeared to be a holiday. It would have been
idle to look for the regular uniform, correctness of evolutions
and discipline, where probably neither the power nor
the wish to attain these existed; a few only wore a uniform
of neat grey colour with sash and long feather; the rest in
the usual dress, and each man armed with his rifle. The
amusement or chief exercise of the day, beyond the roll
call, seemed to be firing at marks, at which they have
justly established a character for great dexterity. Yet
the American has but little skill with his arms in hitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
a moving object, whether running or flying; indeed he
scarcely ever attempts it, and he must too have his accustomed
weapon or it is a chance if he succeeds;&mdash;a
man dexterous with his rifle was admiring the pistols I
carried, and wished to [141] try them; he shot twice at
fifteen paces without even hitting the tree on which the
mark was placed: that the pistols may not be supposed
faulty, I mention, though <i>no practiser</i> with the weapon,
that I hit close to the mark each shot, and with both, for
he would change thinking mine might be the best. The
same person with his own rifle without a rest, (which aid
by the way is frequently taken advantage of,) at sixty
yards shot from a tree a piece of paper no larger than we
could see. Towards evening the multitude dispersed,
and again the silence of the desert prevailed.</p>

<p>At Louisville we first saw the effects of a violent epidemic
disease which had attacked the horses, and many
were dying of it. The disorder appeared first upon the
tongue, without any previous symptoms of fever that I
perceived; blebs or blisters rose, broke, and increasing
in number the whole tongue shortly became completely
skinned and much swelled; the malady extended itself
gradually down the throat, and the animal died, more it
would appear from inability to take in food than immediately
owing to the disorder.&mdash;Almost every horse we met
on the road had caught the infection; at Louisville and
Frankfort, at the last in particular, I saw near forty altogether
in one yard: various were the [142] modes of treatment;
some bled them and gave physic upon the first appearance;
diet, soft mashes with nitre honey and the insides
of gourds: the animals seemed to suffer greatly from
hunger. The local applications were a mixture of copperas,
alum, and blue vitriol pulverized and rubbed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the tongue twice or more each day, in order to destroy
the activity of the disease, and a frequent washing between
these applications, with honey and alum water. This
was the mode of treatment I adopted,<a name="FNanchor_47_102" id="FNanchor_47_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_102" class="fnanchor">47</a> for three of my
horses caught it, and they all recovered, though one was
reduced so low that I was obliged to exchange him at
Maysville. With the others we continued the journey
without the delay of one day, and they were in better
condition on re-entering Philadelphia than when they
left it.</p>

<p>At Lexington (Kentucky) we stopped at the Indian
Queen which is a good house. Another change of notes
became here necessary; those of the Bank of the United
States were not to be procured, and no others being received
with any certainty on the road, I sold the notes
changed at Louisville for dollars at a further discount of
two and a half per cent, and even [143] for this bargain
I was again beholden to the good offices of the same gentleman
who had kindly cashed my draft when going westward.
My dollars were put into a bag, and as I returned
swinging them along to the tavern, the weight caused some
reflections on the different effects on mankind of specie
and paper as circulating mediums;&mdash;the first, by its
weight obviously tends to make one think more of expenditure
even in small sums; the latter, by the facility it
affords of carrying in the pocket-book sums of any magnitude
must have a directly reverse effect;&mdash;perhaps one
of the greatest evils attendant upon the paper money system
may be attributed to this cause, and the very inconvenience
which I now experience of carrying an inconsiderable
sum in specie might therefore, if general, be an im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>portant
means of raising the value of money, and of establishing
economy in public and private affairs.</p>

<p>25th. Quitted Mr. Chamber's hospitable house at
Maysville; and crossing the river ascended the steep hill
which immediately presents itself in the State of Ohio.&mdash;On
reaching the top we received the first intimation of a
change of weather&mdash;snow had fallen and did not disappear
the whole day from the shade; gales of wind now
blew, and rain had lately fallen in different [144] parts in
sufficient quantity to render the roads wretchedly bad:
our progress was now slow and frequently difficult;&mdash;we
passed several laden waggons of emigrating parties
either set fast in the clay and digging out, or broken down
and waiting for the aid of some distant blacksmith. This
was a sad change of scene, however we kept up a good
spirit, and having a light though strong carriage, good
cattle, and helping these with our own exertions up some
of the steepest hills, we surmounted all difficulties, and
arrived without accident the end of the fourth week at
Washington, Pensilvania, distant from Vincennes about
five hundred miles.</p>

<p>Travellers, whether through unformed tracks of distant
countries or over the mighty mass of waters, must
possess minds little susceptible of impression, if they do
not, in such situations, feel themselves more peculiarly
under the protecting hand of providence. To pass safely
a length of way, where a false step might frequently bring
destruction, is alone a subject of thankfulness; but to
have seen themselves within a moment, a hair's breadth
of destruction, and to be preserved, must bring the sentiment
to their minds with tenfold force: one day while
traversing Ohio State, a gust of wind blew off the top of
a large dead tree, which fell with a [145] tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
crash on the spot over which in another moment of time
we should have been passing!</p>

<p>At West Union, a small town with a good court-house,
we had intended to sleep; but on arriving found the whole
place full of people and to obtain beds impossible; at
which the owners of the tavern very civilly expressed their
regret, and though in the midst of hurry and bustle thought
to speak for beds to the owner of a good private house,
three or four miles further who happened to be in the inn.
While the horses were feeding however, we went into a
room, the table of which was covered with a profusion of
fowls, ham, veal, beef, and many other symptoms of
plenty; to partake of which the hostess very hospitably
pressed us, and, that we might not be backward in accepting
her proffered good cheer, assured us that it would
be no loss to them, as every thing on the table would be
swept away not to appear again; for especially upon these
occasions nothing was ever brought on a second time.&mdash;"Have
you no poor people to accept of the remains?"
said I. She knew but of one family, she replied, to whom
it could possibly be acceptable, and she did not think
even these would receive it. An additional instance this,
proving that food is abundant in [146] this country.
Paid here for a new horse-shoe about eighteenpence
sterling.</p>

<p>In passing through Ohio, the Derbyshire of the United
States, we found in the sitting-rooms coal fires used almost
generally in preference to wood; but from an extraordinary
prejudice, which even exists at Philadelphia and
other places, wood is still used for the purpose of cookery,
and they will not believe that a dinner can be dressed properly
at a coal fire.</p>

</div>

<p>We again slept at Wheeling, and again were much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
pleased with the situation. Old Major Sprigs<a name="FNanchor_48_103" id="FNanchor_48_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_103" class="fnanchor">48</a> did us
the honour to entertain us at his very good house, though
it was very perceptible that he, in common with so many
more, is not in charity with English blood: as a proof of
the feeling, he was complaining of the rats about his premises,
none of which vermin, he said, "were to be found in
the country before the English brought them!"</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the season for Venison. A
man came to the door with a horse-load which the Major
bought for threepence sterling per lb., the price asked.
Let not the reader long for American venison and fancy
it to resemble a fine haunch fed in an English park; it is
lean and more like horse-flesh, with very few exceptions.</p>

<p>Many families and other parties were still waiting [147]
here, and at other places where we had crossed the Ohio,
until the rising of its waters should enable them to pass
down to the west: this did not happen, I was told, in the
past year until the month of December; and to all appearance
it may be as late this season; during the interval
these poor people are exhausting their resources, losing
their time, and at last will pass down the river at a most
unpleasant and dangerous season of the year, if the ice
should permit, a circumstance not probable: those travellers
therefore, who intend such mode of conveyance, (a
very pleasant one in summer,) should not start later than
May; as the waters rapidly subside after June, when it
frequently happens that none but light and nearly flat-bottomed
boats can get down.<a name="FNanchor_49_104" id="FNanchor_49_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_104" class="fnanchor">49</a>&mdash;[148] The rivers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
North America it must be acknowledged are grand, but
this annual loss of water will perhaps ever be a drawback
to their utility which no art can remedy. I am more than
half inclined, however, to withdraw this opinion, for American
enterprise is alive to the object; and two works which
I saw in progress, and which by this time may be finished,
give promise that much may be accomplished;&mdash;one of
these is at Louisville, where a canal cut at great expense
will enable vessels to avoid the Falls of the Ohio, dangerous
at all times, and often impassable;<a name="FNanchor_50_105" id="FNanchor_50_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_105" class="fnanchor">50</a>&mdash;another on
the Schuylkil, where the aim is to deepen the water sufficiently
to render it at all times navigable.<a name="FNanchor_51_106" id="FNanchor_51_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_106" class="fnanchor">51</a> Weirs are
carried at certain distances nearly across the river, leaving
a space for a short canal with two locks to pass
vessels.</p>

<p>Should this plan become generally adopted on those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
rivers where the navigation fails annually from the loss
of water, it will, among other good results, conduce essentially
to the health of the climate; by preventing the stagnant
pools left in hollows, and the exposure of slime and
mud to the sun, now the pregnant source of disorders.</p>

<p>Where, or when an American uses water for the purpose
of washing more than his face and fingers, [149] does not
appear, for no water ever goes up stairs at a tavern unless
your own servants take it. Under the shed of the house,
water and tin basons are placed in the morning, and each
one on coming down rubs his face and hands over;&mdash;they
may bathe perhaps in the rivers occasionally; if not,
they are decidedly dirty people.&mdash;An English youth at
our inn at Wheeling in order to wash himself a little more
effectually, let his shirt down to his waistband; an attempt
at cleanliness so unusual, caused a general surprise and
laugh among the <i>yahoos</i>.</p>

<p>At a small place called Claysville, a stage from Washington
(Pensilvania), a man came to offer to the tavern-keeper
for sale a fat pig; the price he demanded was about
two shillings and sixpence sterling per stone of fourteen
pounds, and I was told that he would have taken a quarter
less.&mdash;Another proof this, if one were wanting, of the
cheapness and plenty of food.<a name="FNanchor_52_107" id="FNanchor_52_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_107" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>We stayed a day at Washington, Pensilvania, comfortably
received at Mr. Morris's good tavern, and then took
a new route by the south-west corner of this State: crossing
the Monongahela river we baited at Brownsville,<a name="FNanchor_53_108" id="FNanchor_53_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_108" class="fnanchor">53</a> at an
excellent house kept by Mr. Evans, an emigrant; from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
[150] thence, by a fine new road through Union Town,<a name="FNanchor_54_109" id="FNanchor_54_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_109" class="fnanchor">54</a>
we soon entered the picturesque State of Maryland, and
arrived at a small town called Fort Cumberland. The
traveller by this route will pass the mountains scarcely
knowing it, except from the fine views of the subjacent
country which are frequently presented to view; that from
the top of the hill about eleven or twelve miles west of
Cumberland is truly magnificent. Along this well-formed
road we pass without once being stopped to pay toll, and
I understood it to be the intention of the United States
government to finish and support this western road, from
Washington the seat of the government down to New
Orleans, by a fund to be raised solely for that purpose; a
liberal plan and worthy of imitation. Of the few picturesque
stations it has been our lot to see, Fort Cumberland
stands first; it is not in itself a town of any importance
or containing many good buildings, but surrounded as it
is by mountains covered with beautiful foliage, and its
stream winding through the vale, it forms a whole worthy
the pencil of a master: at the distance of about six miles
are some natural curiosities of rock, cave, and waterfall,
which, owing to the lateness of the season, I did not chuse
to lose a day in viewing though invited to it by the respectable
old Patriarch of [151] the settlement, who in
his ninetieth year yet offered to walk and accompany us
to the scene.</p>

<p>The reader will be mistaken if, from what has been said
of good roads and fine weather, he supposes we meet
with nothing else; from a few miles off Wheeling until this
day or two, the air has been filled with what in England
would be thought a thick fog,&mdash;here they say it is smoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
arising from burning barrens and prairies which are yearly
at this time set on fire; indeed we have lately passed near
enough to woodland on fire to see the flames and to hear
the crackling of the timber; to our eyes a melancholy
sight, accustomed as they have been to value and admire
the forest growth. This brings to remembrance what has
been told me of the great danger, and of lives lost in the
Prairie country, from the custom of setting fire to the long
grass in order to obtain a fine beautiful herbage, which,
in a few weeks after succeeds it: the devouring element
assisted by the wind advances so quickly that the speed
of a horse has sometimes proved unavailing. The effect
upon the long rushy grass as the fire reaches it, is frightfully
grand; the heat first elevates and then throws it
forward like waves, thus crossing the country at a rate
inconceivably rapid;&mdash;instances have occurred of houses,
cattle, and people suddenly falling a sacrifice to this rash
[152] method of clearing the ground: the way to avoid
such a catastrophe, the neglect of which occasioned to Mr.
Flower the loss of some stacks, is to mow the herbage to
a sufficient distance round the premises.</p>

<p>Nor is this danger to be apprehended only in the
Prairie country. An emigrant, crossing the mountains
some few years ago, wrote thus back to his alarmed friends,
"the fire is before and behind me, I dare neither go forward
nor return, and what will become of me I know not:"
as his letter came safe we will hope he escaped.</p>

<p>Within this week a considerable number of waggons
laden with goods and people have passed on their way to
the Western country: as this Indian summer cannot last
much longer, these parties would seem to be some of the
improvident of the earth not to have moved earlier to
their destination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 13th.</i> The journey to-day, though over high
hills and tremendous rocky ways, has been one of the
pleasantest drives we have experienced: the clouds were
just sufficiently broken to throw as they flew, endless and
varied light and shade over the most beautiful and extensive
views; rocks of various forms presented their rugged
surfaces amongst the thick growing Pines and Oaks which,
though small and stunted compared [153] to those in the
Western country, are not on that account the less picturesque;
and though the land is also equally inferior, yet
such scenery, healthy air, and good water, must I conceive
render Maryland a desirable residence to the man of refinement
and property, in preference to any part that I
have seen.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i> A day more beautiful never opened or continued
throughout. The national road not being finished we had
twelve miles of the old track yet to pass, over rocks and
gullies.</p>

<p>Maryland is a country of high narrow ridges, much rock,
and but little land of prime quality; the timber, chiefly
pine and oak, is small,&mdash;the rock which on this route
everywhere abounds, is much of it strongly impregnated
with iron; there is also much of it limestone and granite.
Ridge after ridge we passed, rewarded by many an extensive
and beautiful view, until at length after an hour's
toil up Sidling Hill we entered upon the new road and
bowled along down to the small town of Hancock near the
Potomac, skirting that beautiful river to Fredericktown.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> Fredericktown<a name="FNanchor_55_110" id="FNanchor_55_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_110" class="fnanchor">55</a> stands in a good situation,
having a fine view of the ridges of hills immediately west
of it. The place is about half the size of Lexington (Ken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>tucky):
the inhabitants seem to be rich, having erected
many good [154] buildings both public and private, the
latter very tastefully and expensively furnished. The
Court-house, a handsome building, stands in a square
which is <i>yet to be</i> gravelled; on one side we remarked a
lofty shed under which were hung an enormous pair of
scales, seemingly typical of the purposes to which the
central building is devoted. Churches are plentiful, nine
in number and some of them well built. Talbot's tavern
excellent and good attendance, but charges, as they are
every where on this road, very high.</p>

<p>This is a Slave State; an institution hateful to English
ears; yet I will observe again that after travelling through
three slave States, I am obliged to go back to theory to
raise any abhorence of it: not once during the journey did
I witness an instance of cruel treatment, nor could I discover
anything to excite commiseration in the faces or
gait of the people of colour&mdash;they walk, talk, and appear
at least as independent as their masters; in animal spirits
they have greatly the advantage: doubtless there may be
instances of cruelty, but I am inclined to think that such
are of rare occurrence, and this for other reasons, as before
remarked, besides those of humanity. Upon the
question "What is the proper place of the Black in the
order of creation?" (a subject which, after so much has
been said on both sides, yet remains [155] in dispute,) the
tendency of the above observations may seem to place him
subordinate to the white&mdash;the next link in that chain of
gradation, almost imperceptible to us, which nature exhibits
throughout all her works: yet is the man of colour
in general orderly in his conduct under the every-day
duties of life, and also instances are not wanting of superior
abilities among them, though they have not had per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>haps
fair-play shewn them in this respect. I may have
occasion to observe more hereafter on this subject, meanwhile
let it console the philanthropist, that if the black is
not in his proper place, yet he possesses comforts, and appears
very contented.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> At Baltimore. The view is fine from an eminence
about half a mile from the town, nor are you disappointed
on entering the city; though not so large, it is
yet the most pleasing by far of the three eastern ports we
have visited: whether the beauty and taste, the variety
and neatness of the buildings, both public and private
be considered, or the plan and situation&mdash;the whole is
indeed strikingly interesting. A beautiful marble column
is in part finished, a national monument to the memory
of those who fell in the battle at North Point;<a name="FNanchor_56_111" id="FNanchor_56_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_111" class="fnanchor">56</a> not
far from this is in progress a superb Catholic cathedral,
and close to it stands a Unitarian church, an edifice not
surpassed [156] in beauty by any in the city. Besides
these there are a variety of churches and other public
buildings: one of the most prominent the College of
Physicians, a very heavy combination, and not rendered
the more pleasant by, we will hope, the inappropriate
neighbourhood of a burial ground. On the whole the
traveller cannot but be pleased with a view of Baltimore
and the State of which it is the chief town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>On leaving Baltimore about half a mile, a large burial
ground presents itself on the road side: the Americans
inclose these places with little or no fence, and very frequently
bury their dead with little or no ceremony;&mdash;as
we passed this ground a man within it was carrying a
child's coffin under his arm, which he was going to inter
apparently by himself.&mdash;Mr. Birkbeck mentions the summary
method in the western country of felling a tree across
the spot where they inhume a body: but the tree had sometimes
been removed, and we frequently drove over hillocks
in the wilderness under which lay the bones of the departed.</p>

<p>The road now led along the western edge of the grand
bay of Chesapeak, of which we caught frequent and delightful
views&mdash;here indeed may America justly pride
herself; her bays and rivers stretching to a great distance
from the coast&mdash;[157] surely nothing in nature can exceed
for grandeur or utility. Havre de Grace at the mouth
of the Susquehannah is a small place, but beautifully
and healthfully situated: it was burned by us during the
last war, they say upon very small provocation, which has
given a blow to the little prosperity it enjoyed; and a bridge
now building at a short distance up the river, by rendering
the ferry useless and turning the present road, will further
hurt it. One of the greatest dainties, the canvas-back
duck, is here obtained in great numbers and sent to Philadelphia
and Baltimore markets; though this was the season
for them, we were not so fortunate as to feast upon the
delicacy. The Susquehannah is navigable for large
vessels to the bridge, and for small craft, I was informed,
for near five hundred miles up the country.</p>

<p>The tavern at Havre de Grace is far better than that
on the opposite shore; we had good beds and attendance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
The ferry, about a mile wide, is well managed; on landing,
we drove on through Elkton, Christiana, and Newport
to Wilmington, a large town near the Delaware, and a
place of some trade: the State Bank is a good building.
At night reached Chester; the first inn was quite full and
the next nearly so, which appeared very unaccountable;
but on enquiry learned that it is [158] the chief <i>retiring
place</i> for Debtors, where in about five weeks residence
they get cleared of the <i>Dun disease</i> and come out themselves
again.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i> A beautiful day: breakfasted near the small town
of Darby, and shortly after once again entered Philadelphia,
after an absence of four months, and a journey of
above two thousand five hundred miles performed in good
health and with much interest throughout.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>I now take leave of the Western country of the United
States; and although the reader may perhaps be enabled
to gather from the foregoing observations sufficient whereon
to judge for himself, yet it may be proper to sum up
that which I have to say upon it; and it may be done in a
few words:&mdash;First addressing all those who are possessed
of capital, I will state, that if they are content to undergo
for their own lives many difficulties, and to make a certain
sacrifice of many of the little comforts they can possess
and have been used to enjoy at a moderate cost in England,
they may then for a trifling sum establish their posterity
upon a good estate in America, which hereafter may place
<i>them</i> in affluence; and this may be accomplished at a
distance far short of the Prairies of Illinois;&mdash;but let
them be again reminded [159] that it must be done at
some risk, much trouble, and a certain sacrifice of many
of their own comforts: so much for those who look forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
As to immediate prospects, taking the different ranks,
professions, and businesses in turn, I must first assure the
gentleman and the idle man that they have <i>no business</i> in
any part of the territory. The farmer who has been accustomed
to the regular markets, the constant labourers,
and the comforts of an English hearth, will here find the
reverse of all these and more; not so bad perhaps in the
country nearest to the eastern cities as in the west, where
labour to manage more than a small portion of his land
is not to be had; and if it could, there is either no market,
or it is so distant that the small price he can obtain for his
grain renders it little worth growing; whilst this very distance
from market which thus acts against him, also renders
the price of all groceries at least double that which it is
in the Eastern States.<a name="FNanchor_57_112" id="FNanchor_57_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_112" class="fnanchor">57</a> For professional men I saw no
opening, unless it may be for dissenting teachers in religion.&mdash;There
are many young physicians spread about
the country who keep taverns for their support; as to
lawyers, there are enough for the population. [160] For
manufacturers there may perhaps be found some employ:
but it is principally the young poor man who can turn his
hand to anything&mdash;the stout agricultural labourer, for
whom this country is at present calculated; here such men
may, with reasonable labour and activity, in a short time
realise a little property, and after living in comparative
plenty and comfort, leave their families to enjoy the same
with independence. It is emphatically the country for
the poor man; but he must not go thither, as many have
done, expecting no difficulties to be encountered, no privations
to be endured; nor must he be disheartened at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
finding a cool reception, and work not immediately offered
on his arrival at the Eastern ports;&mdash;he must push forward
westward without idly stopping to spend his money
and waste his time; work his way if money runs short
(he may at all places get food at least for his services,)
until he arrives at a place where hands are wanted and
good wages are offered for them; he has then a fair and
near prospect of comfort, taking care only to be industrious,
frugal, and especially to avoid habits of drinking, a
vice the most difficult to withstand where the spirits of
the country are to be obtained for half a crown the gallon.</p>

<p>There are people with us in England who object [161]
to giving the poor man any facility of emigration, and who
are disposed to condemn prospects held out to him of improving
his present condition by a change of country; I
shall not stop to argue with such narrow policy and truly
anti-christian reasoners more than to say, that I will leave
them to point out, for I cannot, even in a political point
of view, any loss to a country arising from the emigration
of a <i>redundant</i> population.</p>


<h3>A WINTER AT PHILADELPHIA</h3>

<p>Though a winter passage across the Atlantic may be
quick it is almost always unpleasant; this thought, aided
by a wish to see a little more of the climate and people ere
I should bid to both farewell, determined me to stay till
spring. The following notes and reflections are the fruit
of the protracted residence, and they are presented to the
reader nearly as they stand in my journal: in their nature
they must be desultory, and by essaying to render them
more connected, the little interest they may possess might
be made yet less.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>December</i> 6th. A beautiful day, even warm, as indeed
the mid-day has hitherto been, yet the [162] thermometer
in an east room window opened at early morning stood
at 33&deg;.</p>

<p>Rode with D***** to the view on the Schuylkil called
the "Flat Rock." On the way called at Mr. Fletcher's
screw factory,&mdash;Mr. F. took pains to explain to us the
machinery, though after all we best understood the <i>result</i>;
one of the machines cut the iron rod into proper lengths
and turned out seven screws complete per minute; with
only the attendance of a boy, it forms thirty-five gross per
day. Two miles more partly along the bank of the river,
and amongst its beautiful scenery, brought us to the Flat
Rock, and we crossed by an inclosed wood bridge. One
of the dams which have been already mentioned is here
formed, and there is a canal on one side with locks for
the passage of vessels;&mdash;the broad cascade of the silvery
waters sparkling in the sun over the dam, and the high,
broken, and wooded banks of the river, presented a scene,
even without the aid of foliage, enchanting. We returned
by the old Lancaster road, making a pleasant ride of
about twenty miles. In the evening called with D**** on
Mr. H. This gentleman's life affords an instance of successful
industry, by no means uncommon in this country
of enterprise and speculation; it is also interwoven with
some extraordinary incidents. At setting out in life's [163]
career he and a brother laid out their several portions in
goods such as they judged best for the market, and with
them sailed for this country: the venture proved fortunate;
the goods were quickly sold to great profit, and his brother
again set sail for England to purchase more with the produce.
But here a cruel disappointment awaited Mr. H.,
for his relative instead of pursuing the intentions of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
voyage, engaged on his arrival in Europe in other speculations,
lost the whole of the money, and his anxious partner
in America, when riches seemed already to be within
his grasp, received notice of his brother's misconduct, and
found himself suddenly reduced to his last shilling, in a
foreign land, and without a friend! Young and active,
however, his mind bore up against poverty, and, though
at the age now of three and twenty, he took the resolution
to bind himself apprentice to a trade of which he already
knew a little; at this he served his time; by steadiness and
application perfected himself in the business; then set up
for himself in prosperous times, and rapidly made a handsome
income, which he now comfortably enjoys. Let us
here venture reverentially to trace the moral justice of
Providence in the life of the brother, who, though enterprising
and at one period apparently prosperous, was
reduced by successive losses;&mdash;[164] was taken by the
French and imprisoned for several years;&mdash;being at
length set at liberty he got together sufficient money to
freight a vessel at one of the southern ports of that country,
but which in coming round from thence for England
was lost; and himself also soon after perished at sea.</p>

<p>9th. Just returned from a shooting excursion in Jersey.
We saw pheasants, partridges, and rabbits, but few of any
of these were shot: the American pheasant seems half
grouse, the partridge half quail, and the rabbit half hare.<a name="FNanchor_58_113" id="FNanchor_58_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_113" class="fnanchor">58</a>
Buffon and the Abb&egrave; Raynal<a name="FNanchor_59_114" id="FNanchor_59_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_114" class="fnanchor">59</a> have both remarked that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the animals of this continent are larger than those of
Europe, but the fox, pheasant, partridge and woodcock
are all certainly much smaller.&mdash;The Jersey horses are
excellent hacknies, for a pair of them drew us in a lumbering
vehicle eight miles with ease in about an hour along a
heavy sandy road.</p>

<p>We have been told there are no taxes in America, or
that they are few and light; I insert therefore a copy of a
tax paper handed to me by a gentleman of Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/table297.png" width="640" height="180" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>[165] Besides these there are still levied a poll-tax of
one dollar; a dog-tax of one dollar, and I believe some
others. During the last war, a tax was laid upon top-boots,
watch-chains, part of household furniture, and
various other articles.&mdash;Horses and carriages are also
virtually taxed, for the assessor calling to put his queries
in order to make out the assessment asks, among other
questions, "Does Mr. ***** keep a horse or mare, a gig
or other carriage?" and upon being answered in the affirmative
he increases the poll-tax in proportion: this district or
parish officer has, or I am misinformed, in great measure
discretionary powers, and as he is elected by <i>all</i> the inhabitants
of the district, whether they do possess property or
not, the consequence may be easily foreseen.&mdash;Thus are
the Americans pretty well taxed according to their means
of paying: in the country indeed taxes are very little if at
all paid, for the reason that the government either cannot
or dare not levy them; hardly indeed, in some places dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the owners claim the land itself from the <i>Squatters</i>. An
instance of this lately occurred in a distant part of Pensilvania:
a proprietor having heard of several settlers upon his
land without purchase or permission, mounted his horse
and journeying to his allotment soon came up to a good
log house; a Squatter was at his door, [166] and the owner,
by way of entering into conversation with him, observed
that he had erected a comfortable dwelling there; to which
the other assented.&mdash;"But, my friend, I am told that you
and several more have built here without any title to the
land, and the owner is coming to remove you." The man,
who had his rifle in his hand, immediately pointing to a pig
at a distance took aim and shot it dead; then turning to the
alarmed proprietor told him, that if the owner should ever
come to disturb him he would serve him as he had served
that pig.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i> 12th. In the morning attended the episcopal
church, a building handsomely decorated withinside: near
the pulpit, which was placed within the altar, sat a Bishop
in his lawn sleeves, &amp;c. supported in a chair of state of
carved wood, the mitre surmounting the back;&mdash;he took
no part in the service, but I understood he would officiate
in the ceremony of admission to a young minister. In
the middle of the service, otherwise conducted with decency,
a man with a money box came into every pew to
levy contributions for the support of the church. In the
evening went to the Presbyterian church, where we heard
much singing. Here a purse at the end of a long stick
was thrust into every pew for contributions: this mode of
raising funds for whatever purpose is an abomination.</p>

<p>[167] Marriage is here a civil contract, though some
parties have the ceremony read by a minister; in general
they may and do go before the Mayor, a Justice, or as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
they are called here a 'Squire, and declaring their resolution
to take each other for man and wife, the contract is
binding. As to registers I understand they are very inaccurately
kept, if at all in many places, of either marriages,
christenings, or burials, which must occasion most
profitable confusion for the lawyers.</p>

<p>Went with ***** to one of the many billiard tables in
this city; the game usually played is the four balls, two
red and two white. This seemed to me a very childish
play and well suiting the table-keeper, as from the facility
of <i>cannoning</i> the game is soon finished. Returning home
my companion proposed to dive into one of the Oyster
Cellars, to which agreeing we vanished in a trice, and
entering the infernal abode, the heat of which was at least
that of a hot-house, we found a room well lighted and
boxes arranged like our coffee-houses, except that the
partitions were carried to the ceiling and the addition of
curtains in front.&mdash;We supped well upon stewed oysters
brought upon a chaffing dish, and a sallad of finely
shredded raw cabbage and celery, which I found very
palatable; for these with beer we paid half a dollar, and
again rose to encounter the keen air of a [168] frosty night.
It is I apprehend these constant sudden changes of temperature,
and not severity of climate, which destroy the
constitutions of many here, and render the use of flannel
next the skin indispensable.</p>

<p>No one will again say that this country is free from
paupers when he learns that there are subscriptions for
the support of public soup establishments, which find
plenty of employment throughout the winter. 'Tis true
the poor here seem to be more fastidious than with us,
for a pauper in my hearing the other day objected to some
good cold meat offered to her, because it was too cold for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
her stomach, and said she would prefer some money if the
giver pleased.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i> 26th. Went with ***** to a Roman Catholic
church: the altar very handsome, but the architecture and
decorations more calculated for a temple dedicated to
Venus, than for the sanctity of a christian church. Between
the pillars of corinthian order which supported the
altar was a view of the Holy City and the Temple, well
painted in distemper, and before this full as large as life
the Crucifixion, the first view of which sight of horror,
must make a sickening impression; but its constant presence
deadens the feelings, and renders devotion grounded
upon it a mere ceremony, as the "nods and becks and
wreathed [169] smiles" between acquaintances coming in
during the prayers plainly proved. The priest on his
entrance, being finely enrobed in a scarlet velvet and
worked muslin petticoat, commenced his operations by a
very hearty and plentiful use of his pocket handkerchief,
which "I thought to myself" might as well have been done
before his entr&eacute;e; he then with a voice like a bull-frog
began prayers, but after some progress turned short round
from the altar to the congregation and in very familiar
language said he was too hoarse to preach, but would, as
I understood, give them more prayers instead. He again
during prayers took sudden occasion to remind them of
some particular day in the ensuing week, and then finished
the orisons;&mdash;the priest's voice was very pleasingly relieved
by the singing from the organ-loft, it was fine and
impressive. The ceremony of the purse was here too
gone through and then we departed, the organ playing
very well but not very &agrave;propos "<i>Adeste fideles</i>."</p>

<p>An affair occurred last week at New York which caused
a considerable sensation,&mdash;a young man in a fit of angry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
malice stabbed another in the open street with a concealed
cane dirk. He fled, but was pursued and taken: when
brought before the magistrates twenty thousand dollars
were offered as bail for his appearance, which [170] has
not been in this case accepted; though I am told it is not
at all uncommon here to take bail in cases of murder,
or rather manslaughter to speak technically. No wonder
then that duels of that assassin character are of so frequent
occurrence. It is common to practise beforehand
on giving or receiving a challenge, and I believe rifle-barrelled
pistols have been used; if after this a man is admitted
to bail, let the assassin go free.</p>

<p>31st. After a long continuance of fine mild weather,
in the mid-day sometimes even hot, winter comes clothed
in his thickest fleecy covering, ushered in by as fine and
gentle a rain as ever fell in autumn; the snow is already a
foot deep, and sleds, or as they are called here sleighs, are
moving in all directions. These carriages are not only
applied to the useful purposes of life at this season, but
they also afford an amusement much indulged in by all
who can afford it;&mdash;there are sleighs of various sizes
drawn by from one to four horses, and some of these carriages
are of a form elegant enough, and handsomely covered
within by the rich furry skins of the Bear and Buffalo;
the horses wear belts of bells round their necks and bodies,
and also some at their ears; this, which is a legal regulation
intended to give notice of their approach, and thus to
prevent accidents, [171] is rendered an affair of ornament
to delight the eye and the ear, the bells being nicely
assorted to harmonize, and affixed to handsome leather
belts. The fun and frolic consists in large parties forming
a cavalcade of these sleighs to some place of public
resort at a distance, where when arrived, the dance is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
struck up, hot wines are drunk as a refreshment, and in
the night, after a good supper, wrapped in furs and
huddled together, they drive helter skelter home not
"alone by the light of the moon."</p>

<p>Americans make amends for the want of originality of
invention by a quick perception and adoption of whatever
is useful in other nations; without owning that they do so,
they servilely copy us in every thing; for examples among
so many, Savings Banks are adopted to great extent.
Lotteries are of as frequent occurrence as with us; schemes
are for ever publishing, and without any other difference
than the substitution of dollars for pounds; head prize,
20,000 dollars, second 10,000, and so on down to 10 and 5.
The state of pauperism has even obliged them to adopt
the before-mentioned soup institutions, which are now in
daily action at each quarter of the city, besides other
places where bread, and at some, clothing, is given away
to proper objects of the charity; many of whom they say
are Emigrants [172] out of employ.<a name="FNanchor_60_115" id="FNanchor_60_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_115" class="fnanchor">60</a> The newspapers
indeed are full of advertisements for employ, and societies
are established by Englishmen to relieve and forward
poor emigrants to where their services may be wanted;
but I am informed by a subscriber that the applications
to them for working hands are just now but few: work
would be plentiful, but money is wanting, meanwhile Penitentiaries
and prisons and poor-houses are full! This
does not form an inviting picture to the emigrant.</p>

<p>Writers on the United States have too much said the
<i>thing which is not</i>, and too little the thing which is; consequently
I entered the country with impressions which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
have almost all been totally changed by actual observation.
We have been told that suits at law are here quickly
heard and as quickly determined: walking the other day
in Philadelphia with a gentleman, he pointed to some
buildings we were passing, and surprised me by observing
that he had for <i>many years</i> been disputing at law the possession
of them. My landlady too is engaged in a lawsuit
of many years standing, and of which she knows not
the probable termination. Whether these evils are some
for which they may thank our administration is [173] not
here worth enquiring, as a wise nation should have remedied
them when it formed for itself a Constitution; but in
this and many other instances they still suffer under many
of the evils of which we complain.</p>

<p>In a statement of grievances drawn up by a Grand Jury
at a late county Assize in Pensilvania, it is complained that
improper persons are put into the commission of the peace,
and of the improper conduct of such in their magistracy:
it also contains a strong remonstrance against the practice
in prisons of putting the tried and untried culprits together:
the bringing before the Grand Jury causes of a
petty nature, and which therefore should have been tried
in inferior courts, is also objected to.</p>

<p>The militia laws here bear hard upon the Foreigner,
towards whom they are a vexatious tax. A residence in
the country of, I believe, only six months renders him
liable to be called out, and enrolled, or to pay a fine for
absence; yet were a war to take place with the government
to which an enrolled stranger is subject, he is sent up the
country, instead of accepting of his military services; as
it happened to the English who were resident here during
the last war, to the great detriment of their affairs. The
foreigner of course generally submits to pay the fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
rather than be [174] subject to the demand of a military
duty so unjust towards him; but that the practice of procuring
substitutes, should be gaining ground among the
citizens themselves, proves pretty clearly a falling off from
the republican spirit. I have somewhere met with the
remark that the Athenians were so wholly devoted to
public life that they neglected the private virtues: the moderns
on the contrary, and the remark may be applicable
equally elsewhere as here, may be said to neglect their
public interests in a constant attention to their private
affairs; when this is the case, parties may hold intemperate
language, journalists may snarl at each other, but all
will not preserve the liberties of a people who have ceased
to be true to themselves, when, from whatever cause, they
shall hold back from their public duties, more especially
those which are military; they then soon sink into effeminacy,
lose that manliness of character which such exercises
would give them, and becoming indifferent to all
else but sordid gain, let their liberties sooner or later become
the sacrifice to despotism. A militia may not go
through its evolutions so quick and exact as a standing
army&mdash;the latter is also a fine spectacle on a field-day,
when the sun shines&mdash;it is likewise, it must be confessed,
very enticing to indolence to be able to sit at home and
nurse "its dainty [175] sympathies" while the army is
abroad fighting its battles; but the Republic that would
long preserve its freedom, that would truly enjoy the shade
of its own vine and fig-tree, must keep the sword belted to
its own side; must know how to use it, and submit with
chearfulness and energy to its military duties. A standing
army and disarmed population is the awful lever wherewith
despotism and crooked policy have everywhere overturned
the temple of liberty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>But whither is fancy leading me to wander? forgetful
that I am where true liberty is unknown, or where the
Goddess has only deigned to shed the rays of her intelligence
on the favoured head of a Washington, a Franklin
and a few others; while a spirit totally irreconcileable with
the noble, disinterested, high minded, true republican
pervades each bosom&mdash;money&mdash;gain&mdash;sordid gain is
the predominant, almost the sole passion; scarcely leaving
room for vanity; which shews itself not only in a firm belief
and modest assertion that they alone among the nations of
the earth hold the palm in Arts, Arms, and Science, but
also in the important object of decorating the person.
Reader&mdash;know, that the tailor, hatter, bootmaker, here
give to our modern Republican his rank; and by the cut
of his habiliments is known the circle in which he moves,
and in which he [176] must continue to move. As unbending
an order of aristocracy exists here as in any old
court of Europe; and if an unfortunate individual is known
ever to have appeared in an inferior circle, the ostracism
banishes him for ever from the double refined society of
this upper order of store keepers.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 31st, 1820. Went last evening to attend service
at the African Church: a charity sermon was preached
and the whole very decently conducted. Contemplating
however the sable countenances around us, the observation
that the black forms a grade just below the white again
occurred; 'tis true the former seems capable of all the
common mental exertions, so nearly equal with the white
man that it must be confessed he treads close upon his
heels, yet notwithstanding, perhaps the result of a close
examination and comparison of their mental faculties
might shew as much difference between them as may be
observed in the features of the countenance. On which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ever
side the truth of the question may lie, the general opinion
in those States which have formally and publicly called
the men of colour "Men and Brothers" is pretty clearly
shewn in various ways&mdash;separate churches&mdash;civil disabilities,
besides such common advertisements in the
daily papers as the following; which I copy from the
Aurora<a name="FNanchor_61_116" id="FNanchor_61_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_116" class="fnanchor">61</a> of Friday, 25th March, 1820:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus in free Pensilvania are blacks positively sold for a
limited period, and though the law does not allow the
purchaser the power of life and death over this sort of slave,
yet to all other intents and purposes he is in as complete
subjection as any slave in Virginia or Kentucky.</p>

<p>We have lately attended service at the churches of the
Anabaptists, the Swedenborgians, &amp;c.&mdash;Contemplating
the various sects of religion in the United States, men will
be pleased or otherwise, according to their private sentiments,
to see the people on a Sunday quietly moving to
the places of worship belonging to their several persuasions,
without the least symptom of disrespect or rancorous spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
towards each other; thus forming an exception to the rest
of the globe.&mdash;Whether such a state of religion will long
continue, or whether, professing the same end (happiness
hereafter,) [178] they may at length unite in the same
means, one form of religion, time only will demonstrate:
there are indeed people who seem to be of opinion that it
will end in no religion at all; and I must confess thus much,
that though theoretically it is certainly pleasing to contemplate
religion free from state trammels, and each man walking
before his God as his unbiassed conscience shall dictate,
yet, as religion ought to influence men's conduct in
the world, and "a tree is known by its fruit," it would
be satisfactory to perceive, as the result of such religious
liberty, more probity in the every day dealings between
man and man than I have witnessed in the United States.
While they talk of the moral and religious principle; of
true liberty, honesty, &amp;c. their actions belie their words,
and make them appear a nation of unprincipled atheists;
by the bye, a description of people perhaps more general
over the world than we might be inclined to allow; people,
who outwardly profess belief in a Creator and future
Judge of our actions, yet whose daily acts contradict their
professions. But to return to America, where integrity is
at so low an ebb at present, that the nearest relative or
friend can scarcely be safely trusted. One instance of
baseness and ingratitude, among the many, I will relate.
A man some time ago became insolvent&mdash;<i>retired</i> for the
[179] usual period of five or six weeks, during which time
he obtained signatures of release from his creditors, and
came out whitewashed: one would naturally suppose that
at least towards these men he would feel a debt of gratitude
as well as of money due, and he had soon an opportunity
of shewing it; for one of them, to whom he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
most indebted, in his turn got into difficulties,&mdash;and what
followed&mdash;the scoundrel seized the occasion by the help
of chicanery to turn his former creditor into the street
and sold up his goods! Can either a religious or moral
principle prevail where such things are <i>commonly</i> perpetrated?&mdash;Can
the laws be good?&mdash;Can the government
be efficient? Can a country last where such things pass
as clever strokes of practice, and the most successful
swindler is praised as the <i>smartest</i> fellow?</p>

<p>"Such things are;" and while they are, they furnish
ground for such philippics as the following; which I will
insert, not because any calm unprejudiced person or one
<i>not writing for preferment</i> can agree with the pen of gall,
but in the hope that America aroused at such anathemas,
may exert her better self, give vigour to her laws, and blot
out these foul deeds from the page of her history. Speaking
of the principle of honour, the writer expresses himself
thus:&mdash;"Honour alone [180] will indeed never make a
great nation, but it will always preserve it from dwindling
down into thorough contempt. It has done much more
for France than ever virtue did. Without this semi-heroic
principle she would have been detestable indeed. I say
not that she was ever anything very desirable to boast of
with it. America in this respect stands insulated from all
the world. She has neither a spark of true magnanimity
about her, nor any grace or colouring of it. She is equally
destitute of honesty and honour, of substance and semblance.
She set off without an established religion, and
has now pretty well prepared herself for needing none."</p>

<p>In another place he writes thus, "there is no saying what
this same America may turn out in the lapse of ages, or how
far that unprincipled Oligarchy may extend her growing
plagues into futurity, which, at present, exhibits the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
serpents crawling out of their beds of venom in every direction
where the heavens may smile, or the air freshly blow
upon them, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_62_117" id="FNanchor_62_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_117" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Such sentiments as these, from a man professing himself
a minister of "the meek and lowly Jesus," are little
calculated to fascinate and render [181] any people the
more inclined to a church establishment.</p>

<p><i>February 3d.</i> What transitions of temperature!&mdash;the
frost yesterday was severe; the Schuylkill and even the
Delaware frozen over, and skating the order of the day;
the thermometer at ten degrees below freezing:&mdash;last
night a heavy mild rain has fallen, and at mid-day now the
thermometer is at 40&deg;.</p>


<h3>HORRIBLE EXECUTION!</h3>

<p>I shall copy the account without comment; it needs none.
Perpetrated among a people who call themselves christians,
and who boast of being "the most free, the most enlightened,
the most humane people on earth."</p>

<div class="blocksmall">
<p class="ralign">"Augusta, (Georgia,) Feb. 1, <small>A. D.</small> 1820.</p>

<p>"On Friday last, two negro men, named Ephraim and Sam, were
executed in conformity to their sentence, for the murder of their
master, Mr. Thomas Handcock, of Edgefield district, S. C.&mdash;Sam
was burnt and Ephraim hung, and his head severed from his body,
and publicly exposed. The circumstances attending the crime for
which these miserable beings have suffered, were of a nature so
aggravated, as imperiously demanded the terrible punishment which
has been inflicted upon them. [They had shot their owner while
he slept.]</p>

<p>[182] "The burning of malefactors is a punishment only resorted to
when absolute necessity demands a signal example. It must be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
horrid and appaling sight to see a human being consigned to the
flames&mdash;let even fancy picture the scene&mdash;the pile&mdash;the stake&mdash;the
victim, and the mind sickens and sinks under the oppression of
its own feelings,&mdash;what then must be the dreadful reality! From
some of the spectators we learn, that it was a scene which transfixed
in breathless horror almost every one who witnessed it. As the
flames approached him, the piercing shriek of the unfortunate victim
struck upon the heart with a fearful, painful vibration,&mdash;but when
the devouring element seized upon his body all was hushed: yet the
cry of agony still thrilled in the ear, and an involuntary and sympathetic
shudder ran through the crowd."</p></div>

<p>In consequence of the above, the following letter was
addressed to the editor of the newspaper.</p>

<div class="blocksmall"><p>"To Z. Poulson,</p>

<p> &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; "A Philadelphian in thy paper says, the burning
of malefactors is a punishment never before resorted to in this
country,&mdash;I wish the fact were so, but in the year 1800, the following
was published, viz.</p>

<p class="ralign">
"'Charlston, December 4, 1800.<br />
</p>

<p>"'Yesterday was brought to trial, before Justices Johnson and
Glover, Ben and Smart, two negro slaves, the property of Mr. Gregmiles,
for the murder of Wm. Maxwell, ship carpenter.&mdash;The
Magistrates and Freeholders were unanimous in bringing them in
guilty: and further, from the circumstances of aggravation, that the
punishment should be severe. They were accordingly sentenced&mdash;Ben
to be carried between the hours of ten [183] and twelve this day,
outside the tobacco inspection, and there to suffer death by being
burned alive; the other, Smart, to be carried to the place where the
murder was committed, between the hours of ten and four, and there
to suffer the like punishment on Friday the 5th instant.'"<a name="FNanchor_68_118" id="FNanchor_68_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_118" class="fnanchor">63</a></p></div>

<p>That such scenes have at some period disgraced the
annals of most nations it must be acknowledged; for which
even a faint shadow of excuse may be found in the madness
of fanaticism: that they are now sanctioned by cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
blooded sentences from a misnamed bench of justice,
proves this new continent to be some centuries behind in
civilization; a fact corroborated by several others, amongst
the most glaring of which are the perpetuation of the institution
of slavery, and the frequency and mode of conducting
duel combat.</p>

<p>The first of these condemning facts has just been decided,
after much and violent debate in both houses of
Congress; and only by the small majority of four, a majority
which in England would not carry a question, the
New State of Missourie is admitted into union with the
<i>free republic</i> without any restriction as to slaves! In the
course of the discussion, the State of Virginia has gone so
far as to throw out hints hostile, should the question be
decided otherwise than it has: and in this it is understood
she would have [184] been supported by the other Slave
States all deeply interested in the event; as, had the abolition
party prevailed, the next measure would have been
an attempt at general emancipation, which, if carried,
would have been a death blow to the paramount influence
which Virginia now possesses in the general government,
owing to her extent of territory and population, and to
the law which gives to each slave-holder, besides his own
vote, one for every five negroes he has. These causes
have hitherto enabled Virginia successively to influence
the choice of a President of the United States. Another
reason given by the politicians here why the last mentioned
State with Kentucky, and some others, may be careless of
maintaining the union is, that a debt of some magnitude
is due from them to the general Government for lands unpaid
for, taxes, &amp;c., and which, being unable or rather
unwilling to pay, they would cancel by a war. The political
and civil interests of the Slave States also frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
clash with, or are in direct opposition to those which are
called Free.</p>

<p>Another division of this immense country contemplated
as probable, is into eastern and western Governments, the
Alleghany chain of mountains to form the mutual grand
barrier; and indeed I found the subject pretty generally
discussed in [185] the western country, the inhabitants
of which seemed well disposed to the measure.</p>

<p>On the subject of Duel combat mentioned above I
would add a few words, partly of general application, to
the sentiments of so many already delivered. Though
the angry passions of some, and the foolish conduct of
others will perhaps continue to give cause for and never
entirely banish the necessity of appeal to arms; yet will all
sensible men concur in the opinion that it ought to be the
last resort of injured honour, the ultimate remedy to repel
insult. As real christians, we should refuse it altogether;
but taking the world as it is (and that is very far indeed
from true christianity), the combat ought to be regarded
as a serious appeal to heaven, alone justifiable when
human laws have failed to do us right&mdash;when, however
we may as a christian forgive the offender, we yet cannot
keep our honour and overlook the offence:&mdash;in such
situations, and fortunately such are very rare, a man has
no alternative&mdash;he must trust his cause to mortal arbitrement:
but to rush to the combat for any cause short of
this is not true courage, for this is alone consistent with
right conduct;&mdash;it is irreligious, for religion forbids it&mdash;it
is immoral, for it tends to banish virtue and disorganize
society;&mdash;it is barbarous, for it belongs to the wild beast
of the forest; and the [186] people who have recourse to
the combat on frivolous occasions cannot therefore be
placed lower upon the scale of humanity. If then these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
sentiments be correct, what are we to think of those who
can invite each other to the field upon a dispute about
their tailor's bill, or the best mode of peeling a sausage,
with other equally important occasions of meeting among
these mockeries of humanity. From the contemplation
of such, let us turn to behold the more serious mockery of
all that is right, in the chief Magistrate of a nation, and a
considerable part of a nation's council, publicly parading
the funeral of a favourite naval officer, who fell&mdash;not
nobly fighting his country's battles, but pointing at a
murderous distance, with vindictive malice, the weapon
at the breast of his brother officer; on account of an affair
too, with which he had no concern, and for which even his
own friends condemned his interference! He fell; and his
antagonist, who appears to have attempted all which an
honourable man could do to avoid the meeting, remains.<a name="FNanchor_64_119" id="FNanchor_64_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_119" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>After what has been said, it will not surprise the reader
that a store-keeper should put out a board to advertise the
passenger that he has "ten cases of Duelling Pistols on
sale;" though it might to a reflecting mind be little less
hurtful to society than if he had offered ten cases of [187]
picklock keys, or some neat sets of combustibles for firing
houses or blowing up the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Went to visit the Dock-yard and to view a 74 upon the
stocks; within the hull of which it is said one of our 100
gun ships might be placed; and in effect she is framed to
carry as many guns at least, and those of a large size.
The plan of having all the guns of the same size appears
to be good in more respects than one; it prevents mistakes
in loading during action, as the same quantity of powder
will be required for each gun:&mdash;32 pounders are cast here
I understood for the service generally. The Americans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
seem alive to naval enterprise, and no doubt can be entertained
of their becoming very powerful, if they avoid
internal divisions and cordially join in effecting it. It
will not be denied that they have on several occasions at
sea behaved gallantly; but the mere trick of rating ships
of war below their real force, by which they have gained
some few advantages, will no longer succeed, and was unworthy
of the adoption of a brave nation.</p>


<h3>[188] LECTURES ON ANATOMY</h3>

<p>The mansion which the Government caused to be erected
and presented to George Washington for his residence,
and which he, always like himself, only accepted to give it
up for the public benefit, is now devoted to the medical
and anatomical sciences, and is named the University of
Pensilvania.<a name="FNanchor_65_120" id="FNanchor_65_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_120" class="fnanchor">65</a> By favour of Dr. Physic I was presented
with a general ticket of admission to the anatomical
course. On entering the Lecture room, which is spacious,
it was pleasing to see in attendance about three hundred
students; it was not so pleasing however, to hear the impatient
noise kept up by their heels and sticks in the manner
of our play-house galleries, because the Dr. did not
make his appearance quite so soon as expected. This is
both highly indecorous and shewing a want of proper
respect for a man of years and science. Dr. P. ranks high
in reputation, and I believe deservedly: his salary for the
college duties, which occupy his time for four months of
each year, is about six thousand dollars. There are several
other courses of lectures delivered here, all of which
are numerously attended: at the concluding lecture of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
course on medicine given by Dr. Coxe, the very indecorous
conduct of the students in [189] hawking, spitting, and
coughing, while some few lay across the benches asleep,
led me fully to expect a severe reprimand, as they richly
deserved, at the end of the lecture; I was then much astonished
to hear a short, diffident address from the Dr. concluding
with thanking them for their attention! This
they applauded with as much sense and propriety as they
had before coughed, hawked, and spat; by the way, these
beastly habits I am told carry off numbers of young men in
early consumptions.</p>

<p>The Dr. took occasion in speaking on the subject of
fermented liquors, to reprobate, and it may be too justly,
the wine merchants and brewers of England for the custom
of mixing deleterious ingredients in their liquors.</p>

<p>The practice of medicine in Philadelphia, New York,
and other large towns appears to be on a very respectable
footing. Fees are high; on which account perhaps it is
that the operations of bleeding with the lancet, cupping,
&amp;c. are still performed by barbers, and by other ignorant
people as formerly in England; in almost every street is a
sign put out<a name="FNanchor_66_121" id="FNanchor_66_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_121" class="fnanchor">66</a> denoting that these [190] operations are performed
within; it may be supposed therefore that disorders
of repletion are very general. Dentists are well
paid: at New York I had occasion for their services, and
a little Frenchman, who, though now in fashion as a dentist,
had, I afterwards heard, previously figured in the
world as marker at a billiard-table and in several other
characters, was recommended to me, and I sought his
house: after extracting the tooth, which he performed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
very well, he told me among other rhodomontade that he
only now practised "pour son amusement." I therefore
doubtingly requested to know if he took a fee upon such
pleasant occasions, and putting a note into his hand, he
retained <i>only</i> two dollars of it which he pocketed also
"pour son amusement." A lady paid to ****** twenty-five
dollars for plugging three teeth, and another was
charged thirty-six dollars for having her teeth cleaned.
A midwife's common fee is twenty-five dollars and frequently
much more is given.</p>

<p>Empirics too here find a field whereon to gather in a
harvest: imitations of the bottles and labels of the most
successful of our quack medicines are made and openly
advertised for sale to the imitators. Holcroft<a name="FNanchor_67_122" id="FNanchor_67_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_122" class="fnanchor">67</a> it is, I
think, who, in his account of Paris mentions that boards
are to be seen fixed over doors with the inscription "ici on
[191] fait les avortemens." At Philadelphia one of the
same infamous race placards in large letters the corners
of the principal streets with "Obstructions removed at
No. &mdash; in &mdash;&mdash; street."</p>


<p><i>February</i> 22d. Anniversary of the birth of George
Washington. I suppose it was that the people might be
awakened early to pleasing thoughts on this day, that a
double drum accompanied by fifes went thumping through
the city at four o'clock in the morning. Soon after daylight
all was bustle and preparation. At ten <small>A. M.</small> we repaired
to Washington Hall, where an oration was to be
delivered, in honour of the departed hero and friend of his
country, by a young student in the law, one of which profession
is annually chosen for the task; this being an
opportunity of becoming known, and a trial of ability,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
may be of much advantage to a young man. A handsome
spacious room surrounded with galleries was appropriated
for the ceremony; the ladies above, the male
auditors below. At the upper end was a raised platform
for the Orator, the city magistrates, a few military
officers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>During the arrival of the company, a band of about half
a dozen wind instruments stationed in the gallery above
the platform, played some airs, chiefly English, and pertinaciously
continued their exertions while the city militia
with [192] drums, and fifes blowing a different tune entered
the room, and marching up, squatted down upon benches
and ordered their arms between their legs. The din was
horrid, and the idea of seating the military novel.</p>

<p>The Orator now entered and, accompanied by the public
characters, ascended the platform; seats being taken, the
six wind instruments in the gallery struck up the national
air of "Yankee doodle," which immediately set all the
ladies nodding, jumping, and beating time, while some
heavy heels below tried to accord with them.&mdash;This air is
surely of all national airs the most unfortunate; to those
of other nations we may listen with delight;&mdash;the Swiss
Ranz des Vaches&mdash;the Dutch "Orange Boven"&mdash;the
Marseillois' hymn of the French and our own coronation
anthem, and Rule Britannia, have all their several characteristics
of grand, plaintive, or inspiring; but Yankee
doodle! What concatenation can render it agreeable?
What mental images can it conjure up worthy to rejoice
the hearts of a great nation!<a name="FNanchor_68_123" id="FNanchor_68_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_123" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>Yankee doodle over, the Orator, a fine young man but
of very inadequate strength of voice, [193] advanced and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
commenced his address, in which I was surprised to hear
but little of the great character we were met to recal to
respectful memory. It was a rapid panoramic sketch of
the political situation of the several principal powers of
Europe, with all of whom he found fault; then weaving in
an uncalled-for condemnation of Napoleon (a great character,
let history hereafter say what it may of his errors,)
he concluded with an unqualified approbation of the men
and measures at home; not excepting the late decision of
Congress on the Missouri question, which perpetuates
slavery in the United States: in short, he boldly affirmed
that <i>their</i> nation was alone the favoured one under heaven
where true liberty was understood and enjoyed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At the philippic against Napoleon, General H. L'A****d
who sat near me, though he does not converse in English,
shewed well that he understood it, by the indignant colour
which rose to his face: the General was one of Buonaparte's
most attached officers, and being consequently
proscribed by the present French government, sought an
asylum with Marshal Grouch&eacute; and many more on the
shores of America. Here he now resides truly a practical
philosopher after the pomp and bustle of war is over;
after having borne a part in many campaigns; among [194]
others that of Moscow, and enduring the horrors of the
retreat, eating horse-flesh as a luxury, and subsisting for
some time on sugar; and lastly having been engaged at
the final battle of Waterloo. He now lives a quiet domestic
man with his lady and infant, and employs himself in
writing upon subjects connected with his profession; upon
which, as well as upon general topics, he speaks with great
ability and feeling, as one who has thought much and
deeply. It is with pleasure that I seize this opportunity
of inserting a few words of remembrance of this worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
man: it is time that party proscriptions should cease in
France, and I heartily wish he may be reinstated in rank
and fortune.</p>

<p>The address was of course received at its conclusion with
thundering applause; the drums, fifes, and wind instruments
again joined in a Dutch concert, and the audience
dispersed. As we returned home I observed that all the
stores were kept open; no great proof of respect on such a
day.</p>

<p>To instance further symptoms of slavery, and perhaps
a little injustice, in this free State of Pensilvania, where all
men are declared equal by the constitution, the people of
colour are neither called upon to pay the poll-tax as men,
nor are they allowed a vote for representatives or otherwise;
[195] yet all taxes, the payment of which give no such privileges,
are exacted of them.</p>

<p>As this subject may not be again alluded to here, I insert
the following curious advertisement: it may give some
insight respecting the public mind upon more subjects than
one.</p>

<div class="blocksmall">

<hr class='tb' />

<p>28th. Visited the Playhouse&mdash;the piece represented
was "The Battle of Hexham;" very humbly got up but
the parts respectably filled. It was a full house, being a
benefit night; we sat next to the stage-box in the second
row: the party who had obtained the front seats were a
lady and three gentlemen, two of whom kept on their
horsemen's great coats and one his hat the whole night;
this custom is common here. As to the state of the stage,
it is not a subject worth entering upon; there is in fact no
American stage, the players being almost wholly English.</p>


<p><i>March</i> 3d. The meat market here is plentifully supplied
with excellent well-fed beef, good veal and mutton, though
the Americans little [197] esteem the latter. The poultry
too is well-fed and fine. In order to shew to what point of
perfection feeding and grazing have reached, I present the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
reader with some account of the annual Cattle shew, prefacing
it with the advertisement extracted from the Aurora
Journal of March 3d, 1820.</p>


<div class="blocksmall"><p class="center">"SPLENDID AND EXTRAORDINARY
EXHIBITION!</p>

<p>"The public are respectfully informed that twenty-three head
of Fat Cattle, eleven Fat Sheep, and two Fat Goats, advertised to
be exhibited at the Merchants' Coffee-House, by Messrs. White,
Shuster, Fryburg, Drum and Miller, may be seen at B. Graves's
Drove-Yard and Cattle-Market; where the public generally are respectfully
invited to view this magnificent and splendid shew of fine
cattle of American production: such we believe as has never been
exhibited for sale, in one day, in any city in the world, at all events
never surpassed!!!"</p></div>

<p>These animals, such as were "<i>never before exhibited in
any city in the world</i>," I saw; and can vouch at least for
their being very fat;&mdash;the cattle were of middling size, and
frame pretty good, yet judging from their appearance, I
should not have guessed that they possessed (to use a
grazier's phrase,) "an aptitude for laying on fat." Any
particular information of the length of time they had been
feeding, or of the quantity and kinds of food, was not obtained;
but I suspect that though their heads were large
they had pretty [198] well <i>eaten them off</i>, (as prize cattle
are sometimes known to do in other parts of the world,)
and that the grand principle of grazing, laying on flesh
with the least expense of food, has not here been sufficiently
attended to.</p>

<p>When slaughtered, another exhibition was made of the
carcases, and they all proved well, not excepting those of
the goats which were very fat;<a name="FNanchor_70_125" id="FNanchor_70_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_125" class="fnanchor">70</a>&mdash;the tallow in some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the beasts weighed considerably more than two hundred
lb. and the carcases from eighty to one hundred and
thirty stone of fourteen lb. The whole sold for a quarter
dollar (13&frac12;d.) per lb.; but previous to the sale, it was
paraded about the city in one-horse carts, attended by
butchers in neat handsome white frocks with insignia,
and a military band of music <i>in a cart</i>,&mdash;a large model of
a ship upon wheels, having a lad dressed as a sailor in it
throwing the line, bringing up the rear. I have before had
occasion to remark a want of spirit, a flatness&mdash;I know
not what to call it, among the Americans upon public
parades and holidays, when other nations are all life and
noise: not a hat was thrown up upon this occasion among
the crowd, not one hurrah, not even a smile was to be seen;
but all passed by with the quiet and order of [199] business:
they all seemed to be calculating how much the
meat would sell for, or taking in large draughts of conceit
upon having the honour to attend the best beef <i>in the
whole world</i>!</p>

<p>Of the state of Agriculture, the little I saw is not worth
a comment to the English farmer. The price of all machinery
is so high that it precludes the general use of complex
implements of husbandry, and the unexhausted fertility
of much of the soil, perhaps, renders the use of them
less obvious. Clovers are grown in this State in course
of cropping, and we may suppose by the following advertisement
that they begin to know the value of manure.</p>

<p class="center">"TO BE SOLD,<br />

"This day a quantity of Street Dirt, in Lots to suit Purchasers."<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the present low price of land an instance may be
given in the late purchase of two hundred acres, six miles
from Philadelphia, part good grazing ground, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
rest of good quality, including a good and newly-erected
brick house upon it; for the whole of which the price was
five thousand dollars (about &pound;5. 7s. 6d. sterling per acre.)
I believe that bargains as good, or nearly so, may now be
made.</p>


<p>9th. For two days past it has rained and froze as it fell;
the trees, the ships, buildings, [200] &amp;c. are all incrusted
with icicles: the strongest branches of the trees are every
minute giving way and falling under their loads. A ship
at one of the wharfs, being neglected came down, broke
her masts against the wharf and the hull was sunk. In
the country the scene is brilliant and beautiful beyond
description: a letter from the neighbourhood says, "the
spruce, the pine, and the cedar, are coated with transparency,
their limbs bending in every fantastic shape,
whilst the rich dark green of their leaves shows to double
advantage through the brilliant covering; the twigs of the
yellow willow may be compared to amber set in crystal;
the red maple, and the large berries of the sweet-briar,
seem covered with pendant diamonds; the trees at a distance
appear to be loaden with blossoms, white, glittering,
and brilliant; but no description can convey an adequate
idea of the 'fairy frost-work.'"</p>


<p><i>April</i> 2d. As memoranda relative to the climate must
be particularly interesting to those who may think of emigrating,
I notice, that this day a heavy snow is falling,
wind N. N. E.,&mdash;the Thermometer at eight o'clock <small>A. M.</small>,
exposed in shade, 37&deg; of Fahrenheit; yesterday it was
above temperate, but the two days before at the above
hour of the morning, as low as 31&deg; and 32&deg;: the apricots
and other trees which have already put [201] forth blossoms,
must have been injured and many of the trees will
probably be killed. In consequence of these sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
extremes of temperature, garden cultivation is difficult
and uncertain, and the market produce much higher than
in England; a dollar is frequently given for a cauliflower,
and a quarter dollar (13&frac12;d.) is considered a low
price; for a common cabbage I was asked nine cents
(about 5d.,) and most other vegetables bear a proportionate
price.</p>

<p>Called yesterday upon Mr. H*****: the conversation
turned upon the right of primogeniture, a right which
(scarcely deserving to be so called) is not recognised here.
It is true that a man is permitted to exercise it in his testamentary
dispositions, but it is scarcely ever acted upon.
I observed, that though the descent of estates to the eldest
son was strictly agreeable to the spirit of our government,
yet many with us wished its abolition were practicable,
and were of opinion that this would be a great point gained
to the cause of rational liberty; regarding it as strictly an
act of justice, that a father should divide his property
evenly among children who all claimed an equal share in
his affection. In answer, he acknowledged, that his mind
too was so strongly impressed with the equal claim of
children to a parent's support, that he believed he might
in his [202] own case act upon it: yet, he added, that
should he do so it would be entirely unaccordant with his
actual observation of its effects; for, out of very many instances
which had come under his observation, he had
hardly known any which had succeeded; the children had
received their equal portions, but not the experience necessary
to proper management and economy, and consequently
nine times in ten they bought experience with
every dollar, and in the end became either idle, dissipated,
good-for-nothing characters, or had at least to begin the
world again with nothing.&mdash;I asked how the children, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the instances which he called to mind, had been brought
up, and if they had been placed out properly at first; for
if so, it seems to be a manifest advantage that a young
man should possess a sum of money for immediate support
and with which to start in life. He said, that in many
cases the parents had given excellent educations, but he
acknowledged that they had died before the children had
been well introduced into life. "Were it otherwise," he
observed, "were the parent to live long enough to induce
habits of industry and economy, and to see his children
well settled in their respective professions or trades, there
can be no objection to their being equally portioned; else,
an elder brother, especially if he conducts himself worthily,
[203] forms a sort of support to the rest of the family, a
point d'appui, which preserves a share of respectability
to them that in America they experience the want of; he
keeps together that property which would otherwise probably
be squandered, that respectability which would
otherwise be lost."</p>


<p>3d. Mr. K*** having some business to transact at
Washington, the metropolis of the United States, I took
the opportunity and agreed to accompany him. We left
Philadelphia at mid-day, in the steam boat bound for the
small town of Newcastle, on the Delaware, distant about
forty miles; price of passage one dollar and a half: there
were twenty-four passengers on board; a fine day over
head, but snow lay upon the ground and the air piercingly
cold. Arrived at Newcastle a little before five <small>P. M.</small>,
where stages numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. were waiting to take
passengers eighteen miles over the neck of land which
here divides the Delaware from the Chesapeake Bay:
previous to landing we had each a ticket, numbered,
given to us, which each one took to the stage of corre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>sponding
number by which he was to go, and this plan
prevented all disputes and confusion.</p>

<p>Having all taken our seats in these vehicles, which are
a sort of covered waggon having [204] benches placed in
rows across, and the luggage being adjusted, they started
in cavalcade, and in little more than two hours and a half
arrived upon the shore of Chesapeake Bay. It was now
dark, but everything was quickly removed into another
steam boat, much larger than the first, and without any
loss of time its wheels were set in motion and we proceeded
for Baltimore at the rate of about ten miles an hour,
bringing-to at the wharf there about three o'clock next
morning. The steam boats here have been already frequently
described, I shall only observe therefore that they
are of great length, capacious, and as comfortable as carpets,
stoves, good beds, and good meals can make them:
this had three cabins, two aft and one before, containing
altogether fifty-eight births. There are a set of regulations
hung up which are strictly observed; one is that no
smoking is allowed except upon deck; another, that no
portmanteau or trunk be admitted into the cabin: travellers
will do well therefore to take a sacde-nuit with them
for the few things they may want at night; let them not
forget too, to bring some book to their taste in case of a
want of conversation, for Americans are in general rather
reserved. The conversation here was chiefly upon the
recent fatal duel between Commodores Decatur and
Barron; it seemed to be [205] the general opinion that the
latter could not with honour have avoided the meeting:
one gentleman observed that the right man had fallen,
both on account of his conduct towards Barron, and also
for his quarrelsome disposition and general seeking such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
combats; he had, he said, previously killed three antagonists,
of whom two were English.</p>

<p>These American stages or caravans carry all the passengers
withinside, an arrangement which renders travelling
with servants expensive: we were eleven young and
old, closely packed, and jumbled away at the rate of
seven or eight miles an hour, without interest; for we
could only catch a glimpse of the country now and then
by lifting up the side leather. Soon after noon we came
in sight of the Capitol, and were set down at a large
Tavern near to it.</p>

<p>The dirt, ill-arrangement and absence of common comforts
in an American tavern or hotel have already been
expatiated upon amply; but to meet with such things under
the walls of the Capitol, at the very seat of government, I
was not prepared. On entering the Hotel, a poor lad,
whose dishabille of dirt and rags defies description, came
with a brush, which he was making less fit for use by rubbing
its bristles upon his dirtier hand, to ask if he should
brush our coats. We enquired [206] for a room up stairs
to shave, &amp;c., and though past one o'clock not a bed had
been made, or a breath of acceptable fresh air permitted
to blow into these chambers of contamination!-Having
finished the toilette as well as we were able, our first visit
was to the Capitol.</p>

<p>It stands finely upon the edge of a high commanding
ridge, from whence with one sweeping glance one views
the subjacent ground down to the Potomac river, and the
elevated country beyond; to the right is seen George Town
and the most populous part of Washington, the President's
House, the Post-Office, &amp;c. but alas! excepting these and
a few other mostly dispersed buildings, the horse, the cow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and the swine, still graze quietly around the Capitol of
Washington. Viewing however the beautiful site of this
city with the eye of its venerable founder, and with him
letting imagination cover it with houses and "the busy
hum of men," if we then look round for the attractions
of support for this multitude, the illusion vanishes.
Commerce cannot but with difficulty flourish upon the
shallow bed of the river, and agriculture may long strive
for success in vain, with the surrounding sterility. Wherein
then must the motive of the statesman be sought for
founding a city in a place favourable alone to the eye?
Could he make a mistake? [207] That is not probable.
Could it be to favour his native State, or to gratify a whim?
This is not consonant to the character of his great mind.
A despot of Russia might build a city upon piles vainly
to shew posterity his power: Frederick of Prussia might
have his Potsdam; but Washington ever kept utility in
view, and never aimed to gratify a vain wish at the expense
of his fellow creatures. It is then suggested, that,
impressed with the importance of quiet deliberation, he
fixed the seat of government upon a spot so unattractive
to the multitude that their representatives might be unbiassed
by faction.</p>

<p>Of the Capitol the centre is yet to rear its head, the
wings alone are finished; these contain the Hall of Representatives
and that of the Senate&mdash;a Library<a name="FNanchor_71_126" id="FNanchor_71_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_126" class="fnanchor">71</a>&mdash;a Post-Office
for the Members&mdash;Committee Rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Hall of Representatives is of semicircular form; a
beautiful colonnade of native with capitals of Italian
marble, ranges along within the semicircle and its base,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
with rich crimson and fringed curtain drapery between
the columns. The President's <i>throne</i> is placed on the
centre of the base and fronting the semicircle, the seats
and desks [208] for the Members ranged so as to radiate
from it; the whole area is covered with a rich and rather
gaudy carpet.</p>

<p>The Hall of the Senate is as studiously plain as that of
the Representatives is gaudy; in the same form, but upon
a much smaller scale, and the gallery is only upon the base
of the semicircle, so that a spectator here fronts the Members;&mdash;the
style of decoration throughout is far preferable
to the other.</p>

<p>Of the debates on the tapis I can say but little, not having
had time sufficient to give them much attention,&mdash;they
were apparently carried on however with more
decorum than from report I had reason to expect, except
that the exercise of spitting upon the beautiful carpet was
continued as everywhere else; the walls of the stairs and
the stairs themselves also were covered with the saliva of
tobacco chewers.</p>

<p>It being an expected compliment from strangers coming
to the Seat of Government to pay their respects to its head,
we drove down to the President's house, at the hour appointed;
it is a handsome stone building, which has now
been restored and repaired since the shock given to it by
the English; but the gardens and pleasure grounds,
reaching down to the banks of the Potomac, and extending
again up to the Capitol, are as yet only [209] to be seen
upon paper; rude nature still rules absolute over the tract.
Remains of the late snow yet lay in the shade, and negligence,
studied or accidental, had left it upon the flight of
steps to the President's house, an old plank being laid
upon the landing that visitors might get dry to the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
A servant, not a <i>man of show</i>, admitted us into a plain hall,
and ushered us up stairs to the private apartment in which
we found Mr. Munroe seated alone at his bureau with
various papers before him; he arose at our entrance, and
himself placed chairs for us, which his <i>independent</i> servant
had left the room without doing. Mr. Munroe
appeared a plain quiet man in dress and manners, the
English country gentleman with a physiognomy which
bore marks of deep reflection: a conversation of ten
minutes on indifferent subjects terminated our visit,
when, instead of formal etiquette he gave me a friendly
shake of the hand with a "God bless you," spoken in a
pleasing tone, which left upon me a very favourable impression.</p>

<p>The other objects of our curiosity were, the Naval Dock-yard,
George Town, the Patent Office; at this last, we were
much amused by the various models, amongst which,
though I shall not attempt minutely to describe them, may
be enumerated a car propelled with the hands by a [210]
easy and very simple contrivance, a model of machinery
applicable to propelling boats instead of the steam engine,
several models of bridges, a cotton-carder, a plough having
its beam turn upon a centre to save the trouble of swinging
it round at the land ends; these were among the inventions
most attracting our attention, and I now mention them as
a remembrancer to good machinists who may have an
opportunity of viewing them. George Town is an extensive
place and pretty thickly settled; and it much resembles
our more populous villages adjoining to London;
the road is excellent between it and the Capitol, and to
the foot of the hill is lined with houses many of which are
good, substantial, handsome buildings.</p>

<p>In the Naval Dock there was little to review worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
mention to an English reader; we saw a clumsy monument,
erected we were told to commemorate the burning of a
frigate at Tripoli by Commodore Decatur. On the stocks
was a frigate as they denominated it, but which appeared
to be of a size equal to our second rate; and at the forge
an anchor was forming of 10,000lb. weight. These were
the chief objects which attracted attention. On account
of the recent loss of Decatur it was the fashion to be very
dull, and no <i>drawing-room</i> has been held since his death:
we passed the evening with Mr. ****, a Member [211] of
Congress, who had obligingly shewn us whatever was
thought worth viewing, and some amusement was afforded
at a lecture upon the laughing gas, in seeing its ludicrous
effects upon several individuals of the company who inhaled
it.</p>

<p>The following morning, my compagnon-de-voyage
having finished his business, we quitted Virginia, and in
twenty-eight hours were landed again at the Fish-market
wharf in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Fish is well supplied here in quantity but not in variety:
it has hitherto chiefly consisted of a coarse kind called <i>Sea
Bass</i>, but now the Shad fishery is just commencing; these
fish come up the large rivers in shoals, and are caught in
hundreds at each haul with the seine; they are a very oily
fish and weigh from two or three to ten pounds and perhaps
more; being a plentiful season they are just now
bought of the fishermen at the price of five dollars a hundred,
and have been lately as low as three dollars. In the
season of 1818, they sold at sixteen and seventeen dollars
a hundred. Many parties are formed during the season
to see them caught and to partake of them fresh from the
water; one of these being made we took a boat, which carried
us under a pleasant breeze down the river to a place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
called Gloucester Point, here the shore suiting we saw
several seines hauling, and upon the beach caravans [212]
waiting to convey the fish, as quick as caught up the
country, where they are cut open, cleaned, salted down,
and many of them smoked, contributing very largely to
the winter food of the Americans. The Herring season
comes on here immediately after that of the Shad, but it
is not near so much reckoned upon.</p>

<p>Out of the produce of one of the hauls two fish, of about
seven or eight pounds each, were taken, and quickly
brought to table in excellent order;&mdash;the mode of dressing
is to open the fish, nail it to a board and place it before
a fire; it is thus <i>toasted</i>, and being brought in upon the
board quite hot proves very good eating. In the room
where we dined were hung up a printed set of rules of a
fox-hunting club; but how the chase can be followed on
horseback through a country so uncleared and undrained,
it is to me a mystery&mdash;must too often prove like that of
Caliban and his companions following the music of the
invisible Ariel, "through toothed briars, sharp furzes,
pricking gorse and thorns," and ending "i' the filthy
mantled pool;" dry clothes and a cigar the best enjoyment
of the day. By the way we had a specimen here of the
early initiation into the habit of smoking; a fine child of
only about three years old was very coolly walking about
and puffing a cigar, while he looked on at our pastime
[213] at shuffleboard, an obsolete English game, it is said,
though new to our party. The day had been delightfully
fine; but, tempted by the game, we lingered too long at
the amusement, and on the return encountered one of those
violent squalls of wind and rain which are so common here
in spring; it suddenly blew tremendously, and our little
sail was with difficulty taken in&mdash;the party luckily all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
sat steady, or we might not have escaped with the inconvenience
alone of a thorough wetting and spoiled finery.</p>

<p>9th. Incendiaries have lately been dreadfully alert&mdash;the
whole city is under nightly apprehension of fire, and
hardly a day passes without alarm, the roll of fire engines
with the dismal horns of the attendants are constantly
sounding in our ears: threatening letters have been received,
and many buildings actually burnt down. The
Theatre was consumed late on Sunday evening in a short
space of time, fire having been laid in several places;
snow, which lay in the streets, by adding to the reflection
of light increased the tremendous effect. The cause of
these crimes is sought for by some people in religious
bigotry; others look with suspicion on the black population;
and some, not without grounds, have attributed these diabolical
deeds to some unprincipled white people of even
respectable connections. To save themselves [214] from
these unknown desperadoes the inhabitants of each district
or parish, have formed themselves into patroles, relieving
each other nightly; the watch is doubled and every
precaution taken.</p>

<p>18th. The cry of "fire," which begun here, spreads;&mdash;Baltimore
and New York are suffering from incendiaries,
who are now supposed to be mechanics, many of whom
are out of work and most working for low wages.</p>

<p>This general state of alarm and real insecurity naturally
increases the anxious wish once again to breathe English
air. The sails are unfurling for departure, and I should
quit a country without regret where hope supported by
theory has met with disappointment, were it not that,
during my residence, I have found a few individuals
whose worth entitles them to a lingering, painful farewell.
Such characters support a state amidst the vice and folly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of the million. They fill with respectability any station,
for their hearts are good; and of such were America composed
there would be little to say against her sons. As,
however, this is not the unalloyed lot of any the most
perfect assemblage of mankind, the United States may be
supposed to stand upon at least equally fair ground with
others; that she may do so in time I cannot deny,&mdash;that
she does so at present is not my opinion: and truth compels
the avowal, that [215] actual observation of the effects
of republican Government, as mankind are at present
constituted, are not favourable to the improvement of
their nature, or the cultivation of those high qualities
which we may all admire but cannot all possess. Nor is
it necessary that we should: they can alone be brought to
perfection by attentive education; which subsequent reading,
observation, leisure, and deep reflection may refine
into the legislator, the philosopher, the statesman and all
of that rank in society so essential to good government,
united with general polish of manners. Now this portion
of a community needs evidently to consist of but few,
which are sufficient for the important parts they take;
while the rest are immersed in the equally necessary affairs
of trade, traffic, handicraft, &amp;c., falling into the ranks
suitable to their capacities; but that this latter class, even
if they could conveniently forego their daily speculations
and cares, can be expected to act with proper dignity,
penetration, propriety and tact in the character of legislators
and other high offices of common weal, is an expectation
too absurd to need an argument. Do I then
prefer the Government of my own country? I do prefer
it; even with all its many faults to the present mob influence
of the United States: and America must so far get
rid of it as to let talents rise into respect, [216] and form a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
rank in society which she now abhors,&mdash;she must too,
gain more efficiency to the executive part of her Government
or.... I should expect as soon that the good citizens of London,
who are certainly a very worthy body of men in their
proper stations, should become superior to the court in
high knowledge and refinement of manners, as that America
can ever be well-conducted under a Government composed
of men who are otherwise engaged in mercenary
speculations of trade and commerce; these may sharpen
the wits but will never elevate the understanding.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10th. At sea. The farewell is over; the tear has
fallen; and the hearty gripe of the hand between those
who "may ne'er meet again" may not be forgotten. The
anchor weighed, no longer impeding the ship's course;
the last friendly wave of the handkerchief (meaning more
then than is afterwards remembered) has been answered;
and we now pledge a health "to those far away" with
feelings of regret, not unmixed with those of anticipated
pleasure at the prospect of again beholding our native
shore.</p>

<p>The progress down Delaware Bay was rough and
tedious; easterly winds (an uncommon occurrence,)
blowing steadily against us, and the tides alone favouring;
we have been from the 2d [217] of the month working
out. Off Lewistown we lay two days at anchor; pilot
boats came off to the ship, and weather being fine, and
some few additional stores being wanting, a party was
made to go on shore; an excursion which had nearly ended
disastrously. Those who have been at sea are well enough
acquainted with the difficulties of getting down and up a
ship's side, into one boat, and then from that into another,
landing upon a surfy beach, &amp;c. After experiencing all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
this we got on shore pretty well, and proceeding for the
town were agreeably surprised to find a neat village,
though apparently it has seen better days: the soil a dry
sandy gravel, and the country around a good black loam
and clay. Almost for the first time we saw in America
pretty neat gardens well stocked with flowers, in which,
and in the neatness of their houses, the owners seemed to
enjoy much satisfaction. It might partly be the effect of
land after five days tossing upon the water that we
fancied this place so pleasant, and that we thought, if
retirement were the object, a man might well seek it here:
several of the inhabitants very civilly invited the party
into their houses and gardens, and a rich bouquet of flowers
was presented to us by a very handsome interesting
girl the daughter of one of the proprietors;&mdash;may her
beauty last long, and herself meet not [218] the fate of the
flowers she gave;&mdash;they were lost and scattered to the
winds on our passage to the ship, during which we had
sufficient employment to take care of ourselves alone.</p>

<p>The female portion of American society has occupied
so little of our attention, that I fear the omission will be
considered by the ladies here as the most material and
least excusable fault; for, as a drama without female
beauty and devotion to it, is hard to manage with interest,
so a traveller's journal which shall contain no pleasing observations
upon the lovely half of our species must expect
their unqualified disapprobation. Yet would I deprecate
their anger, and place my defence best perhaps upon
the cause for my silence&mdash;where it is our anxious wish
to admire, it grieves us to find fault; especially if we cannot
qualify our observations with some praise.&mdash;Yet, having
entered upon the subject, truth urges on the pen to record
my impressions, however unfavourable they may prove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
As, in the general character of the men so little can be
found to tally with the best drawn models of a noble republican,
so has the education of the women been totally
mistaken. Light and darkness are not more opposite
than the Roman matron and this modern female republican,
who is equally destitute of the sedate, retired manners
so attaching [219] in my own countrywomen, as of the
lively wit and fascinating manners of the French females;
though, covered with the finery of the latter, the poor
things are taught to believe they must be as engaging;
possessing forms, too, not at all or the least possible en
bon point. Brought up entirely ignorant of every real
domestic duty, the method taken to remedy this error,
previous to their marriage and consequent entering upon
those duties, is truly laughable&mdash;they are sent to some
cook and confectioner as pupils to learn economy and
make pastry! and after a practice in tarts, cheese-cakes,
bon bons, &amp;c. for a few weeks, are declared fit to undertake
the important concerns of a wife and mother! Receiving
from nature but little apparent warmth of constitution,
they neither excite interest by intrigue, nor respect
by the domestic virtues, and become completely insipid
beings;&mdash;is it then surprising that with minds so prepared
for frivolity, they should be bent alone upon extravagant
and childish decoration of their persons, which, together
with their total ignorance of domestic economy, is for ever
bringing their husbands to bankruptcy?</p>

<p>It will of course be understood that the above observations
relate chiefly to the inhabitants of the Eastern parts;
and that there are exceptions to be made within the range
of this immense territory. [220] The lovely brunette, the
immediate cause of these reflections, is an instance; and
for a general one, as to form and features, may be men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>tioned
the women of Kentucky.&mdash;But it is time that we
return to our boat. On regaining the beach we found it
laying <i>high and dry</i>, the boys left in charge of her crying
with vexation and fear of the Captain's displeasure at
their not being able to keep her in the water. An awful
black cloud brought on by a violent squall just at this
instant began to pour down a deluge of rain, in the midst
of which we were all exerting ourselves, some in the water
and some out, to launch the boat; which having with
great difficulty accomplished, to jump into her and immediately
pull the oars and keep her head against the sea
was next with great efforts effected; and in this had we not
succeeded, she would inevitably have filled instantly. We
now got through the breakers, and drenched with rain and
sea pulled away for the pilot boat, into the small cabin of
which we dived, and felt comparatively safe from the
squall which increased accompanied with thunder and
very vivid lightning. Near an hour and a half now passed
in working up to the ship though the distance did not
appear great; and then the pilot would not be persuaded
to lay us alongside for fear of the consequences to his
boat in coming in contact with the ship on the [221] rough
sea; so that we were compelled to get out and brave the
elements again in the small boat, a thing not easily managed,
having a lady of the party; the boat was deep in
the water, the sea ran high, and the Captain allowed,
after we were happily received on board just as the darkness
of night prevailed, that the chances had been against
it. Here again we proved that "delays are dangerous,"
the unnecessary one of an hour occasioned all our troubles,
and might have sent us to the bottom; not to expatiate
upon the loss of a large heap of purchased oysters which,
having enough to do to save ourselves, were left upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
beach for the finder. Upon the whole, however, we had
reason to be pleased with this little trip and farewell to
the shore; it had effected a softening of unfavourable impressions;
we had unexpectedly met with youth and
beauty, native feeling and taste, neatness and comfort,
and we departed in charity.</p>

<p>A dismal midnight leave of Columbia's shores followed.
After riding out another day of "hard hearted winds,"
attended by thunder and lightning, the anchor was once
more weighed, and as night approached, we succeeded in
gaining the mouth of the Bay with a sufficient "slant of
wind" to get out. The darkness now became extreme;
and about eleven o'clock the pilot quitted the ship [222]
and went on board his attending boat, leaving his best
instructions in what manner to steer; yet a little apprehensive
on account of the rocks called "Hen and chickens,"
and some other shoals which were yet to be passed.
Two other vessels, the sounds from which could now and
then be heard, were working out at the same time; their
pilots having also left them, their lanthern lights, which
had been watched with some comfort, were extinguished
as well as our own; and we turned in to behold land no
more until we might hail the white cliffs of Albion.</p>

<p>10th. Our good ship, the Factor, has now fairly taken
her departure, and is "walking away" with a tolerably
fair breeze. A fine sky smiles overhead, and the two
ships and several more are in view; one of our consorts
has borne down and spoke, she is bound for the East
Indies and heavily laden. Some immense flocks of small
birds are seen attending upon shoals of mackarel, urging
on their way to meet destruction upon the coasts of America.&mdash;But
it is not my intention to detail at length the
events of the passage:&mdash;we experienced, as many have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
done before, black heavy clouds rising in successive
squalls; the ominous porpoise in shoals leaped forward
above the wave, and darting in again shot swiftly along
seeming to contend with the ship in velocity. The fog
[223] bank at early morn sometimes displayed its illusive
scenery of land, trees, lakes, and mountains; pleasing as
the visions of young Hope, and as unsubstantial. Occasionally
we watched&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The course of the far distant sail<br />
'Till shapeless and lost to the view"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">pressing onward over this world of waters to gain the
hoped-for port; and if by chance a vessel passed near
enough to speak, it was an event highly interesting to all.</p>

<p>The first two weeks were rendered tedious by contrary
winds and calms, but during the rest of the passage the
breezes seemed to blow on purpose to forward us; and at
length, on the 1st June, we beheld the high land of
Erin bearing exactly as our Captain<a name="FNanchor_72_127" id="FNanchor_72_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_127" class="fnanchor">72</a> had calculated;
indeed it is but justice to him to say that his lunar and
other observations were throughout correct. He is a
brave and worthy man from whom we experienced every
polite attention to comfort during the passage. We now
bore up the channel with a strong but favourable breeze,
and passing Holyhead took in a pilot, and the following
morning the Factor was brought safely into dock at Liverpool
(in a hard gale however,) in twenty-four days from
leaving Delaware Bay.</p>

<p>[224] Having arrived in terr&acirc; cognit&acirc; again, I think it
the proper place to take leave of the reader. Should
Fortune, unpropitious at home&mdash;the spirit of enterprise&mdash;or
any other motive, ever induce him to seek the shores
of Columbia, he has my best wishes for success, if he shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
deserve them; and should any of the hints here given
prove conducive to it, my end is answered. And let
Americans cease to show anger at the observations of
those travellers who have visited their country: though
unfavourable the reports we give, they are the best proofs
of the friendly interest we take in their welfare, and of
the hopes we entertain of what they may in time become.
Their soreness upon the mention of their faults is truly
unreasonable, for they are such as they may amend. The
man who should laugh at a blind eye or a wooden leg
would be silly and illiberal; but if satire is levelled at curable
failings the wise will take it in good part.</p>

regarded as the founder of the Philadelphia Library, which he called "the
<i>mother</i> of all the North American subscription libraries." Conceiving the idea
of establishing such an institution, he drew up a plan (1731), and solicited
subscriptions among his friends. By March following, twenty-five persons had
paid their subscription of forty shillings each, and an order was sent to England
for books. Franklin continued to take an active interest in the enterprise,
aiding in selecting books, and from time to time donating volumes. The Philadelphia
Library now occupies two large buildings, and contains over 190,000
volumes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Pennsylvania) for the improvement of the Schuylkill River. Learning that
that work of improvement was likely to be delayed, he made a codicil revoking
the bequest to the Schuylkill improvement, and devoting it to a scheme of continuous
benevolence&mdash;&pound;1,000 each were given to Boston and to Philadelphia; under
the direction of a certain board of selectmen, small sums (not exceeding &pound;60),
were to be loaned to young married artificers at five per cent interest. He
estimated that in a hundred years the principal would be vastly increased, and
the greater part was then to be devoted to public works. However, many
borrowers were unable to repay, and their security proving worthless, the sum
at the end of the first century was far below Franklin's expectation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

This was probably Colonel Richard Taylor, father of General Zachary
Taylor. He was born in Virginia in 1744, and served throughout the Revolutionary
War. Removing to the Falls of the Ohio (1781), he was a member
of the conventions which formed the first and second constitutions of Kentucky,
and was often a member of its legislature. He died in 1826.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

at that time a fine new steam vessel, of I believe two hundred and fifty
tons burthen, was waiting the rise of the water. What a daily loss this detainer
must have been to the proprietors! Many people were staying at Louisville
in order to go passengers by her to New Orleans, a journey of between fifteen
hundred and two thousand miles, which was to be performed in six days independent
of wind: to get back it would require three or four weeks. This vessel
was to convey the western mail to New Orleans&mdash;the accommodations in every
respect were excellent and the whole interior was fitted up in the most complete
manner; the price to New Orleans for each passenger was, I understood, forty
dollars.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Welby.</span>

early in the nineteenth century. The Ohio Canal Company was incorporated
in 1809-10, Congress and the Kentucky legislature conditionally subscribing
for shares of its stock, but nothing was accomplished. About ten years later
the Jeffersonville Ohio Canal Company was organized to build the canal around
the Indiana side of the falls. Construction was begun, but again the project
fell through. Finally the Louisville-Portland canal was commenced in 1825
and completed in 1830, Congress having assisted to the extent of 2,335 shares
of stock. This canal soon proved inadequate, and in 1872 it was surrendered
to the national government. An enlargement was immediately undertaken,
being completed in 1881.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>
